Best Background Check for Marriage Records,5,"I am a DV victim and was relocated with my child. My perp is still on probation for six more months. He recently reached out after nearly a year suddenly wanting to be a dad. At this point I don‚Äôt have to allow it because our child is really little and video calls put me in a precarious position and haven‚Äôt gone well in the past.

Long story short is that this guys anger stems from seeking sex with men on the downlow, and a long history of hiding his sexuality behind a woman. He was violent and convicted of DV with his ex wife due to these issues.

I have reason to believe he has remarried again to a woman who is probably unsuspecting and that is why he now wants to play happy families.

I have been told by therapists that as long as he keeps ‚Äú bearding up‚Äù with women he will always be violent with them. He has only been with a few women and violent with every one of them.

He has put us through so much and I had to rebuild my life alone with an infant in a state where I knew no one. I lost everything and am doing really well and don‚Äôt want him near my child. I worry about what will happen when his probation is up and custody. He has no physical custody, lives in another state, but is on the birth certificate and has joint legal. 

I am seeking help from the DV shelter for advocacy and guidance but wanted to try to find marriage records online. There are many options for records out there but if I am going to spend money I want to make sure I‚Äôm getting accurate and current info and wonder if any of you have walked through doing a background check like this on your perp?

I did do a court search and have the info that he has been compliant with the court during his two years probation, but has had two traffic tickets for not wearing a seatbelt and speeding during this time. I want to be as informed and prepared as I can be, and have a clear picture of what I‚Äôm dealing with.

Horrific emotional and physical abuse- blames and Shames me,10,"

The fight all started over him telling me to cut off 4 of my/our friends out of absolutely nowhere. He was ranting and raving and threatening them. He spit on my face, punched a cabinet, then grabbed his assault rifle. I threw my body on the case to stop him from getting it open, he violently tried to get me off the case to get to the gun which left me covered in bruises. He was in a rage, he didn‚Äôt even seem human. He then fled with the gun in his car and I tried to get In the car to stop him driving off and killing himself, he physically threw me out of it and then floored the accelerator from a standstill and veered the car hard into the road so I was thrown from the vehicle and about to go under tires when my neighbor came out of his house screaming for him to stop. He said ‚Äúi knew you just wanted to ruin my life and get me in trouble with the cops.‚Äù Of course I didn‚Äôt want to, so I tried to protect him with the police so his military career would not be affected. Afterwards I would gently ask that he acknowledge and get help (discreetly) for the physical abuse and threats of suicide. He said he‚Äôd divorce me if I used the word abuse and denied or blamed me for what happened that night. We had been married just 3 weeks. He had to go away for work for two weeks and was acting so cruel and remorseless and telling me not to talk to anyone about it or we wouldn‚Äôt be able to work things out.. I decided not to speak to him while he was gone for work for 10 days, and after just 3 days of some half hearted attempts to reach me he reactively filed for divorce to hurt me, to try to control the narrative (that if I said anything about that night it was because I was vindictive and angry about him filing for divorce), but he didn‚Äôt tell me he filed. The day he filed, I also received anonymous gifts from him in the mail. I am devastated. There was another instance of cruelty last year (forced abortion- during pandemic on my 36th birthday for a child we both wanted and then he changed his mind- horrific) but after 6 months apart he got help and took full accountability and it really helped me heal. Now this.  Thankfully I had spoken to a victim advocacy program in the military and decided to unrestrict my report so they could do a full investigation. The evidence is overwhelming. He will then be mandated into treatment and will also likely be separated from the army and possibly charged. I want to work things out once he had treatment and hopefully gets a diagnosis (BPD? NPD? CPTSD for sure). But he will probably hate me for ruining his life. Help.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Is this abuse? Need advice,10," Today my fianc√©(35 m) shoved my(26f) shoulder back pretty hard to the point I stumbled backwards a couple steps. I was yelling at him because he let in a huge mosquito, and I was trying to kill it with Lysol spray. But he was trying to catch it in a cup to let it outside. I just wanted it dead because I hate mosquitos especially in my house. So I reached my arm up to proceed to kill it with the spray. While he was still looking up at the bug while standing next to me, that‚Äôs when he shoved my shoulder back after he noticed I tried to kill it.  He had never put his hands on me before but I got extremely upset and started to cry not because I was in physical pain but emotionally it felt like he was putting a bugs safety over me. He was saying he didn‚Äôt realize how hard he pushed me and that he thought it was evil I would spray a living thing and torture it by burning it to death. I told him he sounds psychotic and I don‚Äôt know if this is abuse or not. He told me he has grabbed his ex by the throat when she cheated on him and has also grabbed his mother by the throat while she was drunk.

Please Help.,5,"Hello.

I am a teen. My brothers are physically abusive to me and my other brother T. The names of those are 2. L and Q. L is 22 and Q is 18. Q and L are very abusive to me. They beat me up and humiliate me for simple things that are kind of harmless. A time L beat me up for simply not getting him his shoes because I was busy. Today I was humiliated and slapped by Q for simply washing my hands in the kitchen. The excuse was ""why don't you wash your hands in the bathroom you shame? The Kitchen sink is not for washing your dirty hands."" Or 3 years ago when I had to go to a school that was very crappy. You'd get hit by rulers and yelled at if you don't complete homework.

So I used a technique where I'd say ""I want to take a s\*hit gimme 1 sec."" then I'd go to the bathroom and lock myself. Then I'd wait for the buss to go.

My husband threatened the lives of me and his kid. It‚Äôs like his family is living in a different reality,20,"Last Saturday, my husband was arrested for throwing me around the kitchen with our son in his arms, then later pointing a loaded 12 gauge shotgun at me with the safety off. When he pulled the gun I was holding our toddler, so I ran out of the house with the baby, shoeless on our road and hid behind the closest neighbors work barn, all the while scared that the neighbor might shoot me too for trespassing. 

While my son wasn‚Äôt severely injured, my husband was charged with a felony for injuring him recklessly, as well as 3 misdemeanor. Either way, he was on probation when he did this and is looking at serious prison time. Im fortunate that I was the one who had the visible injuries and not the baby. When the sheriffs department showed up, they had to draw their guns on him because he was still holding the firearm on our back porch. 

When they told me the gun was loaded I wanted to puke. This was someone who was familiar with firearms all his life, taught me how to shoot, taught me the basics of ‚Äúsafety always on, always treat it like it‚Äôs loaded, and never point it at something you don‚Äôt want dead or a hole through.‚Äù He was pointing it at me and the baby.  The scariest part was the rage he had on his face while assaulting me was gone, when he had the gun it was totally devoid of emotion. I think that will always be something burned into my memory. 

My son and I were granted an EPO, and CPS came and wrote up a safety plan for my son and I. Because I don‚Äôt have family in the state we were living, I am going to my home state and staying with my parents indefinitely. Thankfully, he can‚Äôt cry kidnapping because he has no rights as long as the protective order is in place. 

I plan to file for a restraining order when I get to my parents home, and was given resources to free legal services. I began the divorce process yesterday. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll give less of a shit when I‚Äôm home with my family, but I swear my in laws are out of their fucking minds. They really think it‚Äôs possible for us to reconcile. One went as far to try to tell me that I shouldn‚Äôt talk to CPS because I‚Äôm on anxiety medication and they can take the baby, as if my proactivity for my mental health is a danger to my son like pulling a gun is. My social worker scoffed when I told her that. My mother in law told me my husband is heartbroken that the felony charge he is facing is related to him hurting the baby, and asked if there was anything I could do to call them and tell them that he‚Äôd never hurt our son on purpose. I told her, no, because that‚Äôs what the reckless part covers. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he didn‚Äôt mean to step on/knock the baby over while he was beating me up, it means he did while doing something dangerous and wrong. I shit you not, my father in law called me the night of and tried to make it a ‚Äúit‚Äôs both of y‚Äôall‚Äù thing and make me feel guilty that I called the cops and he‚Äôs probably going to do prison time. 

I know family is biased but they are on another planet. Do they not understand that their son/brother/whatever could‚Äôve gone from drunk wife beater to convicted murderer? Of his son no less?

My previous posts outline a lot but for a TLDR I was in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship for 3 years, a couple of weeks before I left he raped me, tried it on a lot while I was awake, he was drunk, I wasn't. I told him no VERY forecefully, I'd already told him I was gay previously, and then woke up to him doing stuff a few hours later, I knew I was leaving and didn't want to risk him kicking off so didnt resist. I have photos of injuries in 2019 and some videos of him being verbally abusive. I managed to get out at the beginning of May and he has no idea where I am. 


A MARAC was filled out when I got to the new city and the police were alerted to my situation. I've decided; after much deliberation, to cooperate with the police. I have an initial account on video in my home, he thinks there's enough evidence and it's serious enough to take to CPS and charge him. The detective has referred me to the department that deals with sexual abuse and I am going to give a formal statement of all of the abuse on video in 2 weeks in a sexual assault centre. 

The officer will be male, I've requested a woman but there aren't enough for me to have one. He seems lovely but it's not ideal. I've been told the centre staff will support me before and after but I have to be alone with the DC when I give my statement. I'm very confused, when they question him (that's the intention and there's a warrant for his arrest in the area I live in now) he will be entitled to have a legal representation present. Why do I have to be on my own? 

I have various mental health issues, he made a habit of pushing me and pushing me until I lost it, he'd then record me shouting and being erratic. He's told me all along that if I go to the police he will show them all the video evidence he has of me ""being an abusive lunatic"". I'm not naive, I know this will go against me, it's my word against his of why I got to that point. 

What should I expect? How the fuck do I get through this without having a breakdown? How long will this all take. I'm just scared, once he is questioned he will know the city I've moved to based on who is interviewing him, the police have agreed to give me an alarm system for my person and for my home. But I'm so so scared he's going to find a way to get to me or just try to mess with my head. 

He'd have killed me if I stayed. I need to make sure he can't do this to another woman. He thinks he's the victim, he's so messed up.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Help my ex wants to buy a car off of me but I don‚Äôt want contact I‚Äôm scared,10,"Can anyone give me advice on this...? Background: My ex was abusive physically, emotionally, and financially. He‚Äôs double my size, and has a gun. I‚Äôve left him over a year ago. 

Now to my problem:
My first car that I got (handed down from my mom) was basically thrashed by him. He manipulated me into using it all day everyday. He has got into many car accidents (his fault) and his anger issues caused him to destroy the inside as well. 
My family and I gave up on that car because it caused a lot of tension in our family and it‚Äôs just plain bad memories. It‚Äôs been sitting near his friends house for a year now with no one using it. 

So he now needs a car and wants to buy my old one off of us for some odd reason. The car probably doesn‚Äôt even fucking work. 
Today he texted me: I have money for the car to give to your mom. Fuck it I‚Äôm coming to your house. 

This scared the shit out of me. I‚Äôm scared of him. Not to mention I‚Äôm home alone right now. I managed to get him to stop trying to come to my house by saying ‚ÄúLet me talk to my parents about it so wait.‚Äù 

I DON‚ÄôT want to sell him the car because I don‚Äôt want me or my parents to ever come in contact with him again.

I‚Äôm afraid if I flat out refuse to sell him the car, he may get angry and try to do something to me or my property. 

What can I do or say in this situation?

Got my husband arrested on Sunday- I feel miserable,6,"I got my husband arrested on Sunday, We had a terrible weekend, which all came to a head on Sunday night with him grabbing me by my throat, pushing me backwards, then taking me by my hair and throat and shoving/throwing me forward into the couch.   


My husband stopped me from calling the cops, so he could place the call himself. He said he was going to have me arrested, but I didn't care who called so long as the call was made. It's a long story, but he was arrested, saw a judge, released and back home.   


I'm writing right now because I'm incredibly depressed. I'm  miserable. I can't figure out what to do because he truly honestly can't believe he was arrested. He truly believes I had him falsely arrested. He truly believes the officers treated him unjustly. I don't know how to handle that information. How? If every other time it was an apology and knowing you did wrong and don't leave i'll change- how is it now that you did nothing wrong? How is that even possible?  


I don't get how he didn't think he could be arrested for pushing shoving and hitting me? He told me that ""Whatever you said got me arrested. They didnt' tell me what you said."" I just stared at him. I was and am still so confused. I told him that I told them the truth of what happened. I told them the whole truth- I even went all the way back and started on Friday so nothing would be forgotten and they had an exact timeline. Step by step, word for word, I could even give them timing for the moments I checked the clock and had something done at that time (like I checked the time and say it was 907pm so I told him he had some time to get to the store to grab a case of water). My husband didn't say anything- just grumbled that it was bullshit. He said- I just don't understand how you hit me on the head with a bag and I get arrested. I just stared. I didn't hit him on the head with a bag. We were arguing about turning the TV off and he got angry. He didn't want the TV off- I needed to have it off there was too much auditory stimulation. He'd watched TV all day- I woke up at 7-8am he was watching TV, we as a family left for the zoo around 12pm, arrived back home around 5-6pm, I took myself out (never walked into the house) got back around 7pmish he was watching TV.

Husband can't believe he was arrested for throwing me around.,9,"We've been together for 15 yrs. In the 15 yrs, I can count how many times he has pushed, shoved, slammed, dragged or grabbed me by the throat on just two hands- he doesn't hurt me physically very often. He's a master at emotional abuse.   


Sunday I had enough. We were disagreeing the entire weekend Fri-Sun. Sunday night, it all came to a head. A shouting match about turning the TV off. I needed to have the TV off- the auditory stimulation was too much on top of the kids and our argument. I went to bed Sat with him watching TV. I woke up Sunday to find him watching TV. We went out, then I went out, I got home at 6pmish to him watching TV. It was 10ish when I told hIm i needed to turn the TV off. He kept repeating ""I want to watch TV"" I've been in therapy since April, I was determined to resolve this without an explosion of anger. I was going to walk away and go to the porch and just give up- but I realized that this really was important to me. The last time we argued about the TV being on and my needing it off- he pushed and shoved and hurt me so bad I had bruises on my arms and throat and legs (I found those pictures on one of my email accounts yesterday and cried) I stopped asking for him to turn the TV off and instead just deal with the auditory stimulation. It just didn't seem fair that I always back down to avoid the fight, to avoid the hurt. My feelings are always unimportant. My needs are always ignored.   


Well he didn't like that. So he grabbed me by my throat, pushing me back into our rolling chair, then grabbing me by my hair and shoving/dragging me forward into our couch where I slammed my breast into the top edge of the couch and my knee to the bottom edge beneath the couch. At this point, I told him that was it. This time he's going to jail. I grabbed his phone and tried to call police, he wrestled me for the phone. I tried shouting for google voice to call 911, he wrestled the phone out of my hand then unplugged the GV. He then proceeded to call 911 himself, to say I had assaulted him. It took a while for the cops to show up, told them everything that happened. He was arrested that night, and released the next day with a protective order that says he can't harrass, intimidate or threaten me while at home.   


Last night, he said he couldn't believe I had him arrested- and that he was arrested at all. I asked what he meant and then I said ""I didn't have you arrested. I didn't ask for you to be arrested. The officers never gave me a choice- they told me what was happening."" He then said that whatever I told them had him arrested. I was so confused. So I told him I didn't understand what he meant by that. I told the officers exactly what happened- I didn't lie. And he was genuinely confused- he said a few times he couldn't believe I had him arrested for the first time in his life ever (he has no record, literally). He genuinely didn't believe that what he did was violence or worthy of being arrested.   


I'm floored. I can't wrap my mind around how he couldn't believe that shoving me was violence. It's not like i walked away unscathed. My knee is fucked up- I couldn't put any weight on it the next day. It's been 3 days and I still have a 3 inch purple and green bruise at the top of my knee- I still can't bend my knee easily.   


I didn't know what to think last night and I still don't know what to think. Does he not realize that his behavior is abusive? Does he really not understand that pushing and shoving is abusive? That refusing to let me leave a room is abusive? That backing me into a corner and not allowing me to walk away is abusive? That refusing to listen, speaking over me, dismissing me, invalidating my opinions/feelings/thoughts, refusing to discuss any issues that bother me but expecting me to correct every single issue he has, are all abusive behaviors.

Was my (F29) father (M66) just a strict parent or domestically violent?,4,"I've been wrestling with myself for the better part of the year whether to post here or not and am very nervous for doing so...I have never told anyone except my closest friends and my partner and even they don't know everything. I don't exactly know where to start or how to explain so I apologize in advance for any ramblings. I have to warn that this is a very long post. Also, English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes.

TLDR; My father dealt out unreasonably harsh punishments and looking back on it I think it was domestic violence and I am still dealing with the effects to this day.

I am the second-oldest in a family of 5 children, all with the same mom, ""William"" (M31), ""Ben"" (M27), ""Nora"" (F26), and ""Jessica"" (F24). We are a South-East Asian family. My dad's way of discipline and keeping us in line is basically to make us fear being punished by him if we were to do something wrong. This includes getting bad marks on tests, lying, not doing homework, getting home too late, or any other things that comes across as disobeying him. He especially hated lying, which is hypocritical as he himself lies, and being a big man with a loud voice, just shouting at us was enough to make us cry. But he wouldn't just shout, he would hit us with things like thin plastic sticks when we were young to belts and broomsticks when we got older, anything hard really, mainly on the palms of our hands and our legs. I once brought back a tree branch from the playground at school that I really liked and he used that to hit me until I threw it away and told him that I lost it, so he told me to find another stick to bring back home. Once when we were still small, he used a wooden stick that was part of a wooden chair and beat Ben with it until the stick (1.5 cm thick) broke and my brother bled.

His punishments would go on for hours, late into the night, him shouting and screaming all the time, and no matter what we said or how we tried to defend ourselves, he would always need to have the upper hand. When trying to explain our point, if we turn out to be in the right, he would just say he is our dad and we have to obey him. We lived in an apartment at the time and we had two other neighbors on the same floor and I would try to open the door and scream/cry into the hallway hoping one of them would help. No one ever did. I was in a swim team at the time, and was so embarrassed about the bruises and marks on my legs. My swim coach would ask and I would always give some kind of excuse. I vividly remember a friend of my father asking me in front of him who I was more scared of, a burglar or my dad. I answered my dad.

One time, when I was around 9, I stayed out playing with my friends past my curfew, and the moment I opened the door to the apartment, my dad was right in front of me, shouting and yelling that I had disobeyed him and that he had no daughter like me. He picked up his wallet, pulled out all the money inside and threw it at my feet, telling me to get out and that that was all the money he had for me. I was hysterical, screaming and crying so hard, thinking I was going to be homeless. I don't remember what happened next, but a very recent conversation with my dad had us talking about this event. He told me that child kidnapping was rampant where we lived at the time and he was scared out of his mind that something had happened to me. He said that when I finally stopped crying, I said in a calm voice that I was sorry and that I would leave, and that was when he broke down crying and hugged me and said he was sorry too.

I feel like I have to say that I know for a fact that he loves me, loves all of us. He can be kind and loving, kissing and hugging us when we were small. We had everything we wanted and needed, within reason, of course. He knew all our friends, hosted birthday parties for us with my mom, bringing back our favorite treats, taking us to playgrounds and parks, picking us up after swim classes everyday without fail, watching cartoons and eating ice cream at night. Each and every one of my friends who met him all said the same thing, that he was so kind. But, throughout all the ""fun and happy times"", the fear of being punished was always, always there.

Me, William and Ben are still ""struggling"" somehow. My two sisters did not receive the same kind of punishments as we did because my dad had mellowed out a bit and they had us three to teach them stuff. William took 7 years to graduate a four-year bachelor's course. Ben dropped out of his Master's program because my dad forced him to enroll in the first place and he just did not like studying. I basically became a version of my dad during arguments with my partner, screaming and being violent, despite my immense hatred for that behavior (my partner called me out on it and I am working on being better). Me and my two brothers has contemplated suicide a couple times over the course of growing up. Yet I am sure my dad thinks he did a great job raising us. We don't do drugs, don't drink (religious reasons), my brothers and sisters have jobs, and I have a masters degree in a STEM field and am currently working in a foreign country.

Because me and siblings were so afraid of being punished, none of us would come and help when one of us were being hit, out of fear for being punished ourselves. As a result, now that we are all adults, we are not close at all. We have very low contact. When covid hit, no one called to check up on me. They came once to visit me but only after I invited them. In the very beginning, I tried to ask them how they were (my parents told me to as I was the most ""mature"") but I stopped as time went on. I have four siblings and its as if I have none. I don't blame them. I blame my parents.

I am almost 30 years old, and yet when my dad's name pops up on my phone, I am still afraid. He hasn't shouted like he did before for 5 years now, and still I look over my shoulder every time before doing anything, wondering if I would get in trouble. I have gotten better about my fear, but it is still there.

I know some of you may wonder about my mother and why she didn't try to help. First of all, she sometimes tried to but it didn't matter. When my dad was angry, nothing anyone says has any effect. Second of all, she wasn't a very good mother herself. She has favorites among us kids, and it showed. I am closer to my dad than my mom, if that says anything. And she contacts me even less than my siblings do. Thirdly, my parents' marriage was not really based on love. My dad had a girlfriend before her of a different religion (even though he wasn't very religious) and it did not work out but I do know she was his real love and that angers my mom. Based on stories told to me by my relatives, my mom was a horrible daughter-in-law to my paternal grandparents when they were alive so my dad grew to resent her even more, and my dad would never listen to anything my mom has to say. His violence was directed at her too, and she gave back as good as she got. They failed equally at being parents, and husband and wife. They are legally divorced now (they used me as the witness) but nothing has changed. If anyone would like more information about this, I will add in later.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

Long term abuse injuries,4,"Hi. I thought I would ask this here since I don't talk to anyone about my abuse and have never gone to the hospital. I've been abused for about 4 or 5 years now pretty severely. I've been slammed around on the ground, slapped extremely hard, kicked etc. What has concerned me most are the head injuries. I've been choked a lot, twice I've lost consciousness and come close many other times. He once punched me in the head so hard it looked like a battle signs injury (never got it looked at). Im pretty sure the cartilage in my left ear is damaged from that same hit. There's a lot of other blows I've taken I can't remember the details of.

Next steps after 911 & Leaving Household after long-term domestic abuse?,6,"Note: this is a throwaway account just in case anything legal becomes involved. Depending on how things go, I may update this from my main account in the future.

My father (57M) has been emotionally, sexually, and to some extent physically abusive for a very, very long time to me and my mother.

Him and my mother have been together for at least two decades. A few days ago I came out as trans officially to my those around me. For more clarification I‚Äôm a trans girl, 17 turning 18 in 2 months, so still a minor. I am also the only child of the household. Was hoping to ride things out until I was 18 but that didn‚Äôt really happen. 

Sunday (June 21, 2021) my father had a particularly off day (generally pissed off mood) that escalated after he took a nap, when that normally de-escalates things. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because I came out as trans or not, it‚Äôs just a hypothesis. 

After throughout the day threatening to kick me out of the house or hit me I left, and my mom (59) left with me, and I called 911. The last thing he said to my mom was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre abandoning me and you gave me a gay son?‚Äù (There‚Äôs a lot to unpack there) It made me laugh when I heard that.

So far nothing has been overall bad, but I‚Äôm not fully sure what the next best step(s) are/is. 

Me and my mom were safe in a hotel for the night. My dad slept in our apartment in a comfy bed with 90% of me and my moms belongings (everything from expensive electronics to my birth certificate). The police couldn‚Äôt do anything since my dad very rarely is physically abusive, they could only suggest we speak to a lawyer. My mom is unemployed and doesn‚Äôt have unemployment. 

For more info I‚Äôm in NJ, USA. I go to a boarding school, and am on scholarship, so relocation within NJ shouldn't be an issue with schooling.

Questions I can think of right now would be:

* Is it worth speaking to a pro bono/for profit lawyer? If so what kind of lawyer? Is it domestic abuse or divorce representation? My mom does not want to go to court. What can I realistically expect them to do? We tried to call two pro bono lawyers but no response as of now. 
* What‚Äôs the best way to get custody of my belongings or apartment? The apartments lease is under my dads name. Also, all of our/my stuff is at our apartment. It feels unfair for the abuser to get all the stuff and get to sleep in an apartment. But just because it‚Äôs unfair I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actionable.
* CPS (child protective services) has yet to call, but when they do what kind of involvement would I be expecting?
* Immediately and future-wise what should I do regarding this?

I can always fend for myself if need be, but I cannot do much for my mother since I‚Äôm a 17 year old in high schooler without a job. My mother is currently unemployed and unemployment hasn‚Äôt come through at all.

Confused.,11,"I think I finally got rid of my abusive ex. Yet, I have this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach and heart. I'm terrified of him, and I haven't even heard a peep from him in over a month. I find myself always looking over my shoulder. Though I am afraid, though the mental abuse, and eventual physical assult was pretty cold I still find myself in the trap of constantly missing this person and thinking about how I haven't gotten over my love for this person. I don't want to miss him. I don't want to love him. I should hate him for what he's done, so it leaves me very confused. I don't understand how I can still feel love for someone that hurt me so badly. I don't understand why I'm thinking about someone who isn't thinking of me, and discarded me. I'm angry with myself, and the frustration just grows with each day that passes and I STILL haven't moved on. I'm tired of constantly feeling the blame I put on myself. I'm tired of feeling like the ugliest undesirable human being on earth, and like I deserved or warranted anything that was inflicted upon me. The embarrassment.

6 month update,7,"6 months since everything happened. 6 months since you put your hands around my neck and screamed at me. 6 long, up and down months. I promised myself I‚Äôd do updates every three months to check in and just got a reminder about my last one. I seemed like I was in a really good place and at the moment I probably was.

That‚Äôs the thing, everything comes in moments. I‚Äôm learning to control my emotions a lot better in the hard moments. The waves of sadness don‚Äôt seem to hit so hard, or the waves of missing you that make me feel so guilty and disgusted. The biggest hurdle I need to face is admitting how I feel and being okay with it.

I do miss you, I miss the smiles, the laughter, the video games, the movies, the singing together to Disney movies. Part of me still loves you too; and I think there will always be a small part that does because that‚Äôs just who I am. I need to realize though that what we had wasn‚Äôt special, and if I really miss all of that I can replace that with someone else. As good as it was it was toxic too.

You screamed at me whenever you got too drunk which was almost every night, you hit me then blamed me, you took advantage of me, you called me names and made me feel like I deserved all of it. You stank, you were dirty, you were immature‚Ä¶there was nothing to love yet I did a lot. Probably the most I ever loved someone.

It‚Äôs okay I still love you as long as I don‚Äôt go back when you come back. I know you will be back and I‚Äôve been preparing for it. I‚Äôve surrounded myself with a good support system, my family is there and I have built myself a life to be proud of. I‚Äôm clean too. I don‚Äôt drink anymore and I don‚Äôt think you can say the same even though you‚Äôre on probation.

The biggest emotion that overtakes me now is anxiety. Fear of when you‚Äôll be back, fear of learning the day when you move on and not being okay with it, fear of vice versa. I still cry some nights because of it but not as much anymore.

As much as I still fight things I am getting better, the moments are getting easier. I‚Äôm hoping by the end of the year I‚Äôll be miles ahead of where I am today. That by a year I‚Äôll be better than okay. Looking back at where I was, I have grown so much.

I need to be kinder and easier on myself. I need to love myself. I‚Äôm doing the best I can and that‚Äôs all I can do. Fuck are some days hard but you know those days are getting few and far between. Right now I‚Äôm on a neutral moment and hopefully in the next few months I‚Äôll be in a better one. 

For now though, I‚Äôm okay with being okay.

Edit: still haven‚Äôt taken the dv classes and still on probation. Been six months and no dv classes, so much for there being a time limit on them.

My sister abuses her boyfriend-- co-dependent turned worse,14,"My sister (20F) recently told me that she gets physically violent with her boyfriend (24M) when he upsets her. Specifically she told me that she hits him and has poured various liquids over him. I do not know what else she has done, but I am sure there's a level of emotional/psychological abuse as well.

She has always had anger issues and been incredibly manipulative, gaslighting and guilting my family. There was a point that my parents gave up. I was not surprised when she told me she had begun hitting him.

She insists that he deserves it because he does things he knows upset her, which range from refusing to engage in heated arguments to sleeping in on his days off. She has done it because he left something off of the grocery list and wasn't engaging with her enough in the store.

From what she has told me, this is part of a pattern of abuse-- she is also very controlling, unreasonably jealous, and manipulative towards him. He was in an abusive relationship before this and may be primed for this type of treatment. Neither of them work or have a social life at all-- they live together and come around on holidays and birthdays. They are pretty isolated from anyone who cares about either of them. 

I am the only one who knows about this and I'm afraid she will escalate if I don't do something about it. I need help figuring out what to do to help her boyfriend get out if this situation and to get my sister the help she needs. I am happy to answer any questions.

Initially posted on r/relationships

Me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship just shy of 4 years, during this time I have never experienced any sort of violence. And the relationship have been loving and nice.

However earlier today as he was eating a dessert treat of those types that is creamy with a coat of chocolate. I nudged his arm (intentionally)with the treat twice so that he got cream on his face for fun as a goofy/playful thing. However after the last time of getting cream in his face he slapped me across the face with enough force for it to sting and turn red. (This was done at a friend of his with the friend in the room). I think I yelped and got tears in my eyes immediately after and shortly thereafter left the room and went to the guestroom where we had been staying.

It‚Äôs not so much the pain from being struck, but the fact that the person I love and trust most in the whole world would inflict pain on me.

Shortly after I left, he came after me and apologised profoundly and first said he didn‚Äôt intend to slap my face but grab my shoulder (both were sitting down) and later changed it to not intending to do it as forcefully as he had. And stressed how he doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me intentionally.

A naive part of me wants to believe him, but right now my trust for him is broken and I am struggling to even look at him. However I told him  I might be willing to try(!) and put it behind me if he goes to therapy which he has agreed to. But I don‚Äôt know what to think or feel right now. However I think it‚Äôs clear to him that if anything like that happens again we are done. But my mind is chaotic and I feel hollow but at the same time it feels like I might burst into tears..

"I‚Äôm having the same stress responses I did when I left my abusive ex, how can I stop them from happening after having a casual relationship end?",1,"(Obvious TW: mentioning of physical/sexual abuse, mentioning of intense anxiety and depression).

I (F19) was previously in an extremely toxic, abusive relationship with a guy who we‚Äôll call Will. He was my first relationship and I never could have imagined how terrible things would become for me. Will manipulated me, was constantly mistreating me, isolated me from my friends, berated me and made me feel worthless, forced me to do sexual things for/with him, would pinch me so hard that he left bruises, threw a phone at my head, punched holes in walls, threw things etc. He tried to cheat on me but when that did not work he just broke up with me and I took it extremely hard. I had become so dependent on him and he had separated me from all of my friends so I really felt like I had no one. I am also autistic and have depression and anxiety so you can imagine how difficult and painful it was for me to navigate the pain of being hurt and then left by him and still having to see him almost everyday due to our similar extracurriculars and just seeing him at school. 

It took MONTHS before I was able to not burst into tears upon seeing him or feeling this inexplicable rage and hurt inside of me. When I no longer had to see him everyday if I saw his picture I would start crying and often would feel sick to my stomach and go vomit. It was hard to avoid because so many people still spoke of him and occasionally a picture would pop up on Facebook or I would get a little ‚ÄúOne year ago today‚Äù thing from my phone and it would be of him. These small things would elicit the same reactions; vomiting, feeling hot and anxious, crying, intrusive thoughts, etc. Eventually I had to delete every picture that had Will in it and block anyone who may be his friend just to avoid this. 

All of this stress took a physical tole on my body, I lost a lot of weight and had constant headaches and aching muscles. I ended up having to have specialized trauma therapy and since January I started to gain back weight, I felt happier everyday, and my daily life got better. At the very least I didn‚Äôt have as much of a load to carry alongside my general depression and anxiety. 

Well within the past month or so I kind of began a relationship with someone who I have always known but never really considered having a relationship with them until we started to spend more time together. 

We‚Äôll call them Alexander (they go by they/them). I really liked Alexander and I‚Äôll admit they were really exciting to be around and I was really drawn to them. But I stayed pretty guarded and told them that I wanted to take things slow to make it easier for me since I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship or trusted anyone enough for one since Will. They assured me that we could go at my speed and understood my apprehension but made it very clear to me that they were ready whenever I was. Things were going really well, it was a little jarring to genuinely feel cared for and to be treated with respect. I really trusted Alexander and felt like things were going well, we had so much fun together and clicked really well. 

Then they started to be pretty distant and were obviously not being honest that something was wrong. Long story short they called things off abruptly and I am still quite blindsided and hurt because in the beginning they were very adamant about wanting to be with me and I had no idea that in reality they were questioning whether or not they were ready for a relationship. I appreciated their honesty and told them that it was ok and that they don‚Äôt owe me anything but I was honest about how confused and hurt I still was. 

Things quickly took a turn for the worst after that. I‚Äôve been crying everyday and having panic attacks and anxiety attacks nearly every night. I‚Äôve had to take double the amount of anxiety medication just to fall asleep and try to not wake up in the middle of a panic attack. I‚Äôve deleted the few pictures I had and unfollowed them on everything. But anytime I got just a glimpse of their profile picture I felt that familiar panic and sadness inside of me. 

Today was their birthday and someone posted a picture of them and I felt so sick to my stomach that vomited and had to take a cold shower to stop feeling like I was going to faint. I cannot live like this again and I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm having these major stress reactions again! Alexander did hurt me and I am definitely mourning the loss of what could have been but they didn‚Äôt abuse me and absolutely tear me apart the way Will did. 

I can‚Äôt live like that again and I don‚Äôt know how to stop these stress reactions and how to stop them from becoming a major trigger as well as keep them from weighing on my everyday life. What does this say about how my future relationships will go? Am I doomed to feel this misery because I suffered so much in my first relationship? 

I don‚Äôt even know where to go from here, I‚Äôve ended up deleting most of my social media so I can avoid seeing their picture but I‚Äôm still carrying this huge load with me always and can feel myself getting triggered by things that remind me of them. Any advice about how to handle dealing with this would be godsend. If anyone has any book recommendations or resources that have helped them or just general advice about how to function in a relationship after an abusive one I would really appreciate it. I do not want to keep living this way but I genuinely feel as though I have no control and like I‚Äôm trapped in my own trauma.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

My best friend‚Äôs boyfriend beat her.,11,"{{LENGTHY POST}}
I am not sure what to tell her. She seems like she doesn‚Äôt wanna file a report or anything. She told me he blamed her for losing money in stocks. She slapped him one time in the beginning of the relationship and she already apologized. She told me ‚Äúhe pulled her hair, throwing her on the ground, elbowed her back multiple times and it‚Äôs not the first time. He had also kicked her several times before. I guess her fault was that she ranted at him for making her do all the chores and not contributing anything. His justification for beating her so brutally is that she ranted at him and hit him(slap and jabbing his arms). She is heart broken and thinks it‚Äôs her fault that she shouldn‚Äôt have slapped him in the first place but I know for a fact that she stopped it after a huge fight and that he has been abusing her with his temper and tantrums. For as long as I have known her she is extremely patient with him and does her best. Her flaws are she tends to hold in due to his bad temper and it came down to a point where she couldn‚Äôt tolerate the mental stress he inflicts on her. She does rant but I feel like she has the right to do so because she keeps so much pain inside of her and he never communicates with her or barely acknowledges her existence. The worst part is I guess he doesn‚Äôt even admit doing anything wrong to her and doesn‚Äôt show any remorse. I have told her that doesn‚Äôt justify him laying his hands on her like that to the point where he could have almost killed her. I feel very sad for her and don‚Äôt know what to do. She seems to be not ready to leave him and he only seems to take advantage of her situation. She dearly cared about his well being but I think sometimes the pain he throws on her makes it very difficult to keep the care consistent. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs possible. I want her to leave him and but I don‚Äôt want him to get away with all the physical and mental abuse he has caused on her.",TW Physical Violence

He's the most violent and deranged individual I have ever met, the scariest man I've ever known, including my own abusive father. 40+ years, a lifetime of abuse.

Healing while in new relationship,7,"Any advice would be much appreciated!

Have been abused in the past where I was slapped, strangled, etc... now that I have a new partner I told him about the abuse. He‚Äôs very affectionate and to him, a gentle slap on the bum is intended to be his way of showing love. He‚Äôs always done it in his past relationships and to his nieces and nephews. It‚Äôs supposed to be a cute thing. 

So he did it to me.... as gentle as the slap was it still made a sound. The sound brought back memories and the sensation of being slapped made me overreact and I just froze. I told him I didn‚Äôt like it but he forgot and kept doing it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.... he‚Äôs not abusive, just affectionate in his own way but I feel like I‚Äôm constantly shutting him down for being affectionate. I have had to remind him at least 3 times now, and I feel so inadequate.

Need help defining whats going on,15,"Hello everyone.

I am feeling very stuck.

Not sure what to do next.  I want to leave my partner. Every moment feels like manipulation and lies. Me, trying to act perfectly to keep my partner happy, and calm. Him gaslighting, twisting, baiting and demeaning me.

In one day this week, I recorded him joking about breaking my neck, responding to a simple question with ""don't make me come over there"", talking about sex acts and more in front of our 3 year old. He makes all comments into jokes and i have no idea really, if this is truly seen as abuse or if i can get help.  
I also dont know the rules for this sub, if i have said something against the rules please ill fix it i just need help. 

He has taken on a cannibal fixation lately. Jokes about eating people a lot because he knows it bothers me. He jokes and kids about serial killers and murder then says im too sensitive and high strung. We sleep with his firearms next to the bed. None are locked. One is just out, so he can grab it any time. When i was trying to get help from a 12 step for support, he told me he should kill himself if i think i need that . When he relapsed and began drinking after a patchy 2 week sobriety, I told him  no I wont leave and trying to mirror him, referenced the fact that he had said hed kill me if i ever left years ago. He corrected me and said no id kill you if you cheated on me. And id kill him too.

Then two days ago, i accidentally saw a text chat on his phone when we were sitting together and a beautiful woman sent him a selfie. 

I just need validation and direction. Sometimes hes great and i feel so unsure like maybe i am too sensitive and these are jokes and its my fault. 

We are never apart so i cant call a hotline  or he will know. I need online resources i can do in hiding but I am struggling to navigate it. 

Anyone dealt with life like this? My post history tells the whole story.

Thank you.",TW Physical Violence
HOW do I leave this abusive relationship,5,"Before I get into my story please do not pass any judgment on to me I situation is a delicate one and this honestly does embarrass me.

My husband (28) and I (25) have been together for almost 9 years now, and we‚Äôve been married for five. We had her first son when I was 18 and during my early stages of pregnancy as soon found that he was verbally abusive as well as petty for still contacting ex-girlfriend‚Äòs, they had also been occasions where he had pushed me while I was pregnant and one slapped me. To me this was not OK but I didn‚Äôt choose to leave because I watched my mom go through abuse and I thought that this might get better. I also knew I didn‚Äôt have a solid family to help me raise the baby and I knew his family had a great head on their shoulders and could give the baby lots of support that mine couldn‚Äôt. After two years of taking the physical and emotional abuse I cheated. It‚Äôs not something I was proud of but in the moment having somebody be so nice to me and show me attention and love like I thought I deserved it felt really good. During this time we had gotten engaged and I still had plans going forward to marry my husband not really thinking of the consequences of getting caught. He ended up finding out the night before our wedding and still married me. It was a terrible honeymoon full of physical fights and lots of verbal ones. Soon after this he started heavily drinking and I knew it was because of what I had done and I knew that it helped him not think about it. Every day after work he would get shitfaced drunk I‚Äôm gonna wake up the next morning go to work and repeat. Along long these years we ended up having two more children and the abuse only got worse. I always express how sorry I was to him and how I wanted to make it work, but I also let him know that if he didn‚Äôt want to be with me I understood because I know I had hurt him. But no matter how many times he hit me and verbally abuse me I stayed because I thought maybe I had deserved it and this will all pass. Unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm at my wits end feeling guilty for what I‚Äôve done all those years ago and for him now having a terrible drinking problem. This is now obviously affecting my children. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to call it a quits for some reason I always want to run back to him and lay with him and get comfort. We get along so well then we‚Äôre good like we were meant to be together finishing each other sentences and always having a great time, I feel like we‚Äôre perfect for each other but I know that what we‚Äôre doing is wrong and terrible for the children and for our own mental health but he can‚Äôt bring himself to leave either he says he loves me too much and wants to keep working at it. There are so many things wrong with our relationship and right now today I let him know that I was done and that we can split the bills 50-50 until one of us can move out. This is a conversation we‚Äôve had many times before but never went through with it but this time I feel like I am done I just don‚Äôt know how to have the strength to keep my promise to myself of being done with it without wanting to run back to him. I know I deserve to be happy and so does he and right now it seems like we‚Äôre both very unhappy and living a horrible life but I feel like he has this obsessive love for me and as usual I feel that he‚Äôll find a way to convince me to stay. I just don‚Äôt know how to stay on the path of keeping my mind straight and firm on not being with him.",TW Physical Violence
Why am I the one that loses everything?,5,"Why am I the one that is constantly lectured about how I handle things and how I didn‚Äôt handle things correctly after I had been beaten by my ex-boyfriend. Why do my friends and family think that it is appropriate to lecture and belittle me regarding the way that I choose to handle the person that did this to me? I have lost almost all of my friends, and pretty much all of my family. Not because of my relationship with this man but because they don‚Äôt agree with the way that I choose to handle exiting the relationship with a man. I have been given ultimatums, I have been basically grounded or treated like a teenager even though I‚Äôm 42 years old. I feel like I am losing everything about me.",TW Physical Violence
I finally did it,10,"I did it, I left.

I have been in a relationship with an abusive man for the past year and a half. During that time, he laid his hands on me countless times, starting at only a month into dating. He would block me from leaving the location, take my cell phone so I couldn‚Äôt call 911 or a friend. I work a full time job, where patient safety can be affected if I am tired. When he‚Äôd get angry, he‚Äôd like to do things throughout the night to keep me awake all night. Kicking the bed, throwing stuff on the bed, ranting at me for hours, and stealing the majority of the covers from me. Then he‚Äôd sleep all day, while I had to go to work. 

I have extreme migraine headaches, from the time I was 5 and I am extremely difficult to treat, because of that I was on a narcotic pain reliever. I did not get very much but I made due with the little I got every 3 months. Enter the ex. He pushed me to push my dr to up my rx, both in dosage and number of pills. While I did require the increase, it wasn‚Äôt for me. It was for him, he started taking my pills. 

In the winter I had an accident (he was not involved), I ended with a very bad concussion and whiplash. I have massive amounts of pain everyday and every evening a pounding migraine. I am in the care of tons of medical professionals and working my ass off to get better. My pain medication is imperative to me living a somewhat normal life right now and him taking it, causes me massive amounts of issues. There are months we‚Äôre he will take as many as 45/90 pills. The thing is, he has his own medication. He gets 140 short term pain pills, plus controls patches, and 80 long term pain pills. My dose is no where near where his is.

We have gotten into lots of alterations but the straw was a couple weeks ago. I told him that he wasn‚Äôt getting access to my meds anymore, my best friend was going to have a key to a safe I have and they will be locked there. He started to escalate, so I typed ‚Äúcall 911‚Äù into a text message to a friend but didn‚Äôt send it, I just wanted it there to send if needed. He saw me typing and grabbed my wrist twisting it, smashing his elbow into my teeth. The impact caused him to stop. I didn‚Äôt get hurt luckily. He tried to convince me not to go forward but I was insistent. He jumped on me and wrapped his hands around my throat, slamming my head against the bed 3 times, luckily it was soft.

Now as I stated earlier, I was in an accident in January. I have traumatic brain injury and severe whiplash. I have changed dramatically since my fall, cognitively I struggle every day. My memory is shit. I can‚Äôt balance and look like I‚Äôm drunk whenever I walk. Emotionally I struggle with not crying. I have so much pain, all the time. Constantly. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time. My vision and hearing is messed up. I can‚Äôt eat because my taste and smell has become so sensitive, that I can‚Äôt handle the flavors of most foods.

He knows that I have trauma to my head and neck but he choked me anyway, he didn‚Äôt give a single fuck about the damage he would do to me, he only cared about his anger and his drugs. 

My heart is completely broken, I tried to get him to go to therapy, domestic abuse programs, drug programs, anything but he is so not interested in it at all. I truly do love him, his past was absolutely horrific and I can see why he turned into the monster he did, he was raised by monsters. I got a protective order against him and a warrant for his arrest, I know he won‚Äôt understand why I did it and will blame me but I‚Äôm just trying to save him. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to be able to get a lawyer in time for my court dates, he‚Äôs going to have a lawyer and has fought/beat 2 other protective orders from 2 other women. I‚Äôm so fucked.

Would I be an awful person if I left the country to get away? (I have a son),13,"I think my ex is going to kill me. I can't hide from him because we share custody, he always has to ahve access to my address and phone number. I can't block him or change my name or anything until our son is 18. 

He's tried to kill me many times, but i have no proof so the police will not do anything about it. I told them that I KNOW he is going to try it again and they said their hands are tied. I don't feel safe and I feel like the only way to stay alive is to leave the country and hide. But then my son would be raised by him and his screwed up family, and probably end up being just like his father.

I've done all the things the list suggests to stay safe but I just don't feel like I am going to stay alive as long as he knows where I live. He is very much the type to hire hitmen (he has gang connections in his home country, but not here. but he is amoral enough to try).

Potential red flags,5,"Hey everyone:)

&#x200B;

I had a moment with my boyfriend and I was interpreting it correctly. It did raise some red-flags but Im not sure if im seeing the situation correctly. 

So for some background, my boyfriend and I have been living together for two years and have been dating for 6 years. We have a generally great relationship although their are times he can be mean. He loves to use insult humour with his friends and he uses it with me even though I've mentioned I don't like it, which I've made clear. In quarantine he's been stressed, he got fired from his job and he's been increasingly rude and mean. 

The particular event that raised red flags for me happened on the weekend. He was high, he smokes a lot, and an argument broke out, i didn't want him smoking in our apartment because I had my sister and her girlfriend coming over. He refused, then stole my phone and told them not to come, which  really pissed me off. 

We got into another argument about that and when I went to leave the apartment he grabbed my arm and dragged me to our room where he yelled at me for at least 10 minutes. After I agreed not to go and not to re-invite them he calmed down and it was like nothing ever happened.

How to I get help?,8,"I'm 23f and my soon to be ex husband is 25m

He decided to leave me over text 3 weeks after he got his green card and has ghosted me fully for about a week now. So I'm sick of hiding all that he's done. He's sexually abused me very severely, He's violently abused me very severely. I have medical records of when he beat me so bad that I have had broken bones, but at the time I was so severely brainwashed and had Stockholm or something that I just didn't see it as such a big problem. He has locked me in the house for about a year and a half and if I tried to run away or leave he would get extremely violent and force me to be naked at all times. I was not able to call family or see anyone. He would promise he will let me see them then when the time came something magically happened to make it change to another day.  I have recordings, and I have pictures of all the bruises he's done. Due to being in a severely abusive relationship just like this, I had a horrible fear of my husband doing it which is why I would record when he got mad and then that's how it pretty much captured how he beats me. It wasn't with just a fist either or kicking me, I have one of the recordings with him beating me with a keyboard. 

I'm just absolutely done with everything and want to essentially destroy everything of his like he has to me. He's in a prestigious school doing one of the hardest possible classes, and I want his school to know what he did so no one will ever let him do his school. I want to send all the evidence to police so that he can be charged and if he ever tries to work, no one for his dream job that he worked for to try to get into for years will ever accept him ever again. I want to Null the marriage because he lied to me and pretended to love and care about me just so that he can get his green card which is fraudulent and therefore the marriage won't be real and he will instantly not only lose the card, but also may be investigated which can result in soooooo much issues from him and probably a ban from the USA.

Need some advice,3,"Hi everyone, 
I've been with my bf (M 38) for 3.5 years (I am F 35). We live together after buying a house last Sept. 

We have arguments over the smallest things and he gets very angry if I call him out on something or if I speak back to him. 
For example last week I purchased a bag of grated cheese for a recipe. He ate the entire bag. I noticed this and said 'did you eat all the cheese? You know I bought that for that recipe I was making'. I know it's not a big deal but I didn't get angry with him. His facial expression changed and he charged at me, grabbed my arms (he always does this so I can't fight back), pushed me to the floor and held a clenched fist infront of my face, I lay there crying and begged him not to hit me. He slammed me down and said 'sort yourself out' when I asked why that happened he said he didn't like how I spoke to him. 

This is one example of many similar situations. I now feel that it is all my fault and I am this terrible person who deserves punishment. I plan on ringing my GP tomorrow morning for help with my mental health.

What should I do?,1,"  

I am getting abused mentally, physically and psychologically every day by my parents. I have three siblings; a 13-year-old brother, a 12-year-old sister, an 18-year-old sister, then there is me, going to turn 18 this year. I live with my parents and grandparents. My father is very abusive to me, often calling me names and hitting me when he feels like it, completely sober. I often feel enraged with his actions, but I do not retaliate against him often, only when I cannot control my emotions. However, when I do retaliate, I remain composed and criticise his parenting, often saying something like ""If I had children, I would never treat them like you do"" or try to understand why he feels triggered by confronting him later about it. When my father feels angry, he will start throwing hands, even to my elder sister. once, my sister called the police on him after he continuously beat her as she was rude to my mum. However, regardless the case, I think that no one deserves to be beat by him. Despite us (my siblings and grandparents) watching her get beat, we did not dare to intervene as we were afraid that he will hit us. My mother, however, is not as abusive as my dad. She will psychologically abuse us by manipulating my father to hitting us, and she is very protective to my little brother. Just this week, she did not like how my little sister told my brother to shut his mouth since he was provoking her by spitting on her. My mother basically pulled my little sister's ear and screamed while canning her just because she felt like it. This is the bullshit we must pull through every day. My parents are also very strict on ""phone rules"" despite me being 17, he allocates timings for me to use my phone and does not allow me to buy a laptop for some reason. I was only allowed to use my phone to play games when I was 16, which I felt was unnecessary since I thought I was old enough to manage myself. Till now, he does not even allow me to buy a pull-up bar, which is just a minor issue with no reason as to why he felt that way and I also have 5 hours a day to use my phone to have contact with the outside world since I am not allowed to go out of my house. (Just to give context to his unnecessary rules) My father is the sole breadwinner of the house, working for the government and he provided my family with two cars and a landed property. Because of this, I feel that if I report him to the police, I will cause him to lose his job, which will affect everyone in the house, which I feel is selfish to my family members as it will affect them tremendously as they are old and are depending on my parents for a small monthly allowance for their food. That aside, I do not have any freedom in my house and get my money or belongings stolen often by my brother, which sadly does not affect just me. He steals from everyone in the house with my parents‚Äô approval somehow. When $70 got stolen from my wallet two weeks ago, my parents blamed me for not hiding my wallet, which does not make sense as it was my house, which I thought was supposed to be the place I was supposed to feel safest. My father has a camera in my room facing my bed, my study table and I feel uncomfortable with it and has told him many times to remove it, but I also do not expect him to listen to me. I really do not know how to deal with him, please suggest to me ways to deal with them Thanks.",TW Physical Violence

"People who have experienced domestic violence, have you ever asked the abuser why they did it?",17,"I (21f) am trying to understand why my father did the things he did to me and my family. He was physically and emotionally abusive until my teenage years when I left home. I always thought it was normal and didn't properly realise it was wrong until I started thinking about having a family with my partner - and then realised no decent person would do what he did, to their spouse and to their children. I have been trying to understand why he behaved like this but I just cannot. It is incomprehensible and tormenting me and is really making me question everything else like the integrity of the love between us. And the fact that my mother let him treat me like that. It wasn't an issue of discipline, I was extremely well behaved even as a small child but he would just get randomly ""triggered"" and turn on me unpredictably. So I have been thinking about asking him straight up, one day, why he treated me the way he did. (I would be physically safe as we are in different countries now.) Has anyone done this before and if so, how did it go? What was their justification? Should I even do it? Would really appreciate any advice, it is so senseless to me and I don't understand why he did this to me and my family, I feel like I can't move on from this unless I understand how on earth anyone could do what he did.

He said he had the option to plead guilty to the domestic violence charge or file a restraining order against me.. not sure of the legalities here, but is that true? 

The police urged me to file a restraining order against him that night, and of course I didn‚Äôt.. not sure what action I should take here.

"My abuser(32f) said I(28f) abused her, and I didn't seek help",13,"**TW There is domestic violence in this story, mentions of suicidal ideation** 

Are there any online support groups for this dynamic? Or anyone I could talk to for help?

I don't know how to start explaining this situation in a support setting. It's terrifying for me to describe. I tried to format this and make it organized, but I've sat here trying to explain myself for 4 hours now and I'm not a good writer. I tried to be clear. If I don't post this now I never will, because I always give up when I try for the last 2 years. I hope I did the TW stuff correctly.

I felt overwhelmed thinking about this tonight and so I made a throwaway account to ask someone. I have tried googling for stories similar to mine and I know this must have happened to someone else, but I can't find anyone. I tried to see a therapist but got overwhelmed during the patient intake and never went back, which was a mistake. I am scared to tell a therapist because I don't know how they'll react. I'm scared of being a monster intruding on victims of abuse and using them to validate me. 

I don't know how in depth to go for what happened between us but will try to quickly give a timeline of abusive behaviors. I was 22 and she was almost 26 when we started dating. Our relationship lasted a little over three years, I was 25 when we broke up. Those years with her are very foggy for me, but most days were normal. Here are some things that happened:

&#x200B;

* Our first year together she bought me a gun as my birthday present. It was a 9mm Taurus handgun that was small enough to comfortably fit in my hand. She expressed concern about me using public transportation for work or grocery shopping, and started forbidding me to walk anywhere. I just thought she was protective and a masculine badass, so I accepted this.

&#x200B;

* She got angry about a coworker at work being rude. She would jokingly yet angrily talk about these fantasies of abducting her, tying her up in a basement and torturing her. 

&#x200B;

* When she was working as a substitute teacher, she said about a trouble making boy who pissed her off that she hopes he has abusive parents that would beat him for getting in trouble at school.

&#x200B;

* Ridiculed my music and was very elitist/controlling about it. I stopped listening to pop or hiphop when we began dating, and she would say things like ""sorry to burst your bubble but this song is simplistic garbage"". 

&#x200B;

* We moved in together and I let her have control over my debit card and bank account. I'm not sure how it started but eventually I didn't own my own money. She lost her job at a retail store and we moved into her mom's house. I continued to work, made payments on her car for her and bought us groceries while paying her mom for letting us stay in the bedroom. Except it was her doing all of that with my debit card. It felt like I was running on a hamster wheel and whenever it got to me she'd promise to go back to work. I experienced a lot of suicidal ideation during this time and had low self esteem. 

&#x200B;

* Around 2 years into our relationship is the first time it got violent. We were having an argument and I exploded, said I was leaving and she blocked the door. I told her to move and she wouldn't. I tried to get around her and she wrestled me to the ground and pinned me. I don't know how long it lasted but I was trying to get out of the house until I was so beat up and exhausted that I spent the rest of the night in bed. At multiple points I would cover my head/face area with my arms while she punched on my body.

&#x200B;

* I eventually became so suicidal I put in a two weeks notice at work and was sure I would kill myself. I worked in the tool department of a Sear's before they closed down in my town. With the help of her mom, my abuser immediately got a job working for the school district as a substitute teacher. As if she knew she could do that and just preferred using me.

&#x200B;

* I wanted to leave again. She grabbed me, wrestled me onto the bed, then put my arm/wrist into some kind of lock. I don't know how to explain this very well, but after pinning me she just kept putting weight on my hand, she bent my hand past where it could bend and I let out a scream in agony. She immediately let off and started sobbing and started this ""Oh god what have I done!?"" apology while I was crying and holding my wrist. It was throbbing and felt warm, like a sprained ankle. It was agonizing to move it so we made a DIY splint out of two wooden cooking spoons, some bandages and an old neck tie. Later that night she said it was my fault for resisting during the lock, and how if I wasn't such a lunatic the accident wouldn't have happened. Thankfully it quit hurting after enough time and it wasn't broken. We hid it from her mom and I was unemployed at this point. 

&#x200B;

* We had an argument where she shouted that I was crazy, got close to me and raised a fist at me. I flinched and threw my hands up, which ended up hitting her face. She screamed ""YOU HIT ME"", her mom came immediately and shouted how there will be no hitting in her household. 

&#x200B;

* She would grab me by the hair and use it as leverage to jerk my head in a direction, ripping some out in the process. I would tell her how I'd rather be injured anywhere else, and how I really wanted her to leave my hair alone. She would dismiss my concern and say I had plenty of hair, as I come from a really thick haired family and hair dressers always comment on how dense/thick it is. This happened more than once, it was at least four or five times she did this and it was always the same dismissal.

&#x200B;

* Had 3 different personas online that I'm aware of. One was of a gay twink that worked for the federal government, for example. It went beyond trolling or attention seeking, she actively socialized as these characters in social communities for over a year at a time. The only time I questioned her on it she guilt tripped me about how much she hates herself. 

&#x200B;

* Once wrestled me to the ground and said I was acting like a psycho. She grabbed one of my Buspirone and said if I didn't swallow it she was going to shove it inside my butthole like a suppository. I told her I wasn't supposed to take it until later in the day, she said that I was so nuts I clearly needed it. When I took it she laughed and said it probably would have actually worked if she had shoved it up my butt. I am diagnosed with GAD and am supposed to take them for that, they aren't like a xanax that calms you down on the spot but function like an anti-depressant, or that's how the psychiatrist explained it. 

&#x200B;

* She got angry during an argument and punched me in the face. All the anger left my body and I just went to bed feeling empty, she cried and apologized before I fell asleep. I had a black eye from that. I started to like the hitting because she turned into this nurturing matron afterwards and would act like an angel. She'd go get my favorite soup and candy and nurse me back to health. Whenever I brought up the hitting as something to work on, she'd explain that it was me attempting to leave that one time that turned things violent. She would admit fault but said I was so mentally ill that things are bleak and I stress her out  

&#x200B;

This next part was the most difficult night with her. It was a few weeks before my trip to the mental hospital and our breakup. I had a black eye, bruises on my arms and body. We were arguing while I laid in bed with my back turned towards her. I don't remember what I said but I had some witty zinger comeback to something she said, and I remember feeling like a smug debate lord for saying it. Without warning she unleashed this blow on the back of my head when my guard was completely down. The pattern repeated and I was crying harder than I ever had, meanwhile she was doing the ""oh god what have I done"" apology routine. 

I begged at her feet to let me leave. I was on the ground sobbing into the floor, saying I felt dizzy and thought I had a concussion and wanted to be anywhere else but in a bedroom with her. I was so overwhelmed that I was screaming I wanted to go to the psych ward and get help. She cried and said how if I went to the hospital she'd go to jail. I told her how I'm loyal and would never tell the police about anything that happened. She said that with my bruises and concussion there was no way the police wouldn't come after her, even if I said nothing. 

Her mom pounded on the door and wanted to know what was happening, to which my ex explained that we got into an argument and ""we both hit each other"". My head was pounding so much that I didn't protest and just accepted that explanation. I just wanted the night to end. I went to sleep and we didn't talk about it after that. Her mom didn't bring it up again either. She said I could get help for my issues once I stopped looking battered.

A few weeks later I said I needed to go to the psych ward and she took me. I told them all about my emotional state, my NEET status, but nothing about getting hit. I described my abuser as really protective and concerned, and the person who urged me to get help. I was there for 3 days, then they transferred me to this psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks and I signed a waiver saying it was voluntary. I wanted help but was dishonest the entire time because I didn't want them to overreact to my abuser. I had a mentality that normal people kneejerk overreacted to violence and couldn't see any nuance in my situation. 

When I got out we got into an argument within 3 days. I locked her out of the bedroom. She turned the handle once, kicked it open(the construction of the home was pretty cheap). I was panicking and worried about what her mom would think, my abuser said she'd take care of it and fix it without her mother noticing. I sat at on my laptop in the room with the broken door while she went off somewhere else for a few hours.

Her mom came home early from work, and said she was going to call the police if I didn't go back to the mental hospital. I was taken by surprise, the two of them staged an intervention basically. I was confused and protested, then went along with it because her mother was adamant about having me arrested if I didn't go. 

When I got to the ER I explained I had just been released to the lady at the counter, and they gave me a wrist band and sat me down. My abuser got to stay with me while I talked to this nurse guy and I wasn't answering sufficiently, so she answered for me. I told him I didn't try to cut myself like she was trying to say, so she stood up and walked out. I was showing the guy my wrists and how they had no cut marks or even scars, then she left without saying anything. I don't remember the span of time but I was saying everything I could to not be put into a 3 day hold. I really didn't want to go back. 

They let me go and when I called my abuser from the hospital she hung up on me. The people gave me a taxi voucher and I took it to a mutual friend's apartment, where I explained to her the situation. She was aware I had been in the mental hospital and let me in. She gave me some of her pajamas, clean socks, food, let me take a shower etc. 

This friend contacted my abuser and was trying to ask what happened. I sat on the couch watching netflix while on and off panicking and not knowing what was going on. I'm sorry it's so blurry but they had a lengthy conversation. My friend said earnestly that she had no idea which one of us was telling the truth, and that she would let me stay but wouldn't hesitate to kick me out or call the police if I scared her. I promised her that I'd stay calm and wouldn't do anything crazy, and that I'd stay quietly on the couch. 

The next day a cop called my friend's cellphone while she was at work asking me if she knew my location. He showed up to the apartment and issued me a restraining order. He said I wasn't under arrest and that he wasn't saying I had done anything, but that this is what she was accusing me of and I had to stay a certain amount of blocks away from her and her mother. He showed me a court date and said it was in my best interest to show up, as not showing up meant there was no one to speak on my behalf. I felt overwhelmed from adrenaline and felt like I was sweating bullets. 

When my friend got off work she needed to know what happened if I stayed. I told her the story. She said my abuser texted her pictures of that door and said I was the one who kicked it in. My abuser was telling her to kick me out and to not trust anything I say, and said I was a danger to myself and her. She said she had known me longer and trusted me more, and decided I hadn't ever hurt her.

She explained the situation to her landlord and they both said I could live there if I tried to get a job, so I started trying. My friend bought me cigarettes because I kept having panic attacks, and they really helped but I was chain smoking like crazy. I didn't have my medication and I quit taking it ever since then. My friend got very apologetic later and said she was sorry for being scared of me for the first few days. She has apologized a few times since then. I tell her it's okay.

The police helped me get all my belongings out of that house a few days later. I had to go with an officer to escort me and he said that I was under no circumstances to speak to anyone in the house. All my stuff was in black trash bags and we took it back to the apartment. There was garbage, like rotting banana peels and food and the contests of a vacuum cleaner mixed with my clothing. They gave me their garbage, and it felt like there was a deliberate effort made to make me dig through food and garbage for my things. 

When I went to court my abuser spoke first. She requested to read from something she had written and the judge allowed it. She described each point above, literally telling the judge every time she hurt me and said instead it was something I did to her. She said she was terrified of being hit, and so only had sex with me out of fear of violent retribution. She said she lived under my terror everyday. She said she was in treatment for the emotional trauma she endured and said I was a master manipulator who could fool anyone. She said I pointed a loaded gun at her, beat her constantly, held knives at her. 

She said ""My abuser is the kind of person who would hit someone even with their back turned."", as a reference to the night she hit me in the back of the head. She called me her abuser over and over. She said she had no doubt in her mind that I was already searching for my next victim. She said I threatened suicide against her when she tried to leave and how she had no way out. She said it was a miracle she survived. I have everything she said in court in this packet, because the judge ordered the pages be given to me after she was done speaking. 

When it was my turn to speak, I said I was not there to contest anything and just showed up because the police officer said to. I wanted to go home and didn't want to fight anything. I got a 1 year restraining order issued that said I engaged in criminal mischief, sexual misconduct, and violence. She said during her speech that she intended to press charges, but that never happened. This was the last time I ever saw or heard from her. In hindsight I know I should have done more but it was too much. I just wanted it to be over and to be done with it.

I contacted an old manager from my tool/hardware department and was able to find a job not long after being in court. She had found a new job and said she could get me hired. I was pretty normal and was just hanging up clothes and folding them, cleaning out changing rooms etc. for a thrift store. One time a coworker startled me by coming up behind me and putting her hands on my shoulders, and I screamed and was shaken up about it. It was almost all women working there and everyone was so touchy-grabby with each other, but after this happened they never surprised me again. 

A manager pulled me into her office and said I behaved like I was under a lot of stress and was really off sometimes. I cried my eyes out to her and explained the psych ward and said I was mentally ill, but didn't tell her about my abuser. I befriended this guy at work and began getting stoned with him at lunch and in the morning, which helped a lot. My head felt like a tornado whenever I was there and I felt like I barely kept it together.

I started smoking weed because without it I always woke up with nightmares, I couldn't make it through the night without it. I would piss my roommate off because I would get anxious and sit in the shower for 5 hours trying to block everything out. I was jumpy and aggressive and felt on edge when I wasn't stoned or drunk.

Towards the end of the restraining order I left the state and moved in with my dad. I started going to community college and am getting close to being able to transfer my credits to the state university. I never saw a therapist or a support group, but I haven't felt suicidal since 2019. I sleep well and don't drink or do drugs. I must sound absurd and like I cry all the time, but I almost never do. I have a pretty stable mood most of the time these days. 

I've dated a few times and end up having breakdowns asking them if I'm abusive or not, and they reassure me that I treat them well. We will have a minor disagreement and I'll get scared, apologize for being emotionally abusive, and then they tell me I'm not emotionally abusive. My most recent partner has had to assure me I'm not abusive a handful of times now, and I don't like making people do that but I get so worried of hurting someone. It's like a can't internally feel confident about what reality is and need something external to reassure me.

 For months following that court date I would lay awake at night trying to figure out if I have empathy or not. I will start reading about domestic violence and will have breakdowns wondering if I'm a good person or a bad person. A few weeks ago I watched a pop-psychology youtube video about narcissistic abuse and ending up panicking while trying to figure out if I'm the abuser they're describing. As I sit here writing this I know that isn't true, but when I'm panicking I don't know what I am. I have diagnosed and undiagnosed myself as a few cluster B personality disorders several times over while my mind races wondering if I have empathy and respect for people. 

I don't know if there is a word for what happened. This is so hard for me. When I begin dating I feel like I have to come clean and I always get so scared they'll think I'm abusive, but then they just pity me and tell me I don't scare them. I feel so much doubt about myself, yet simultaneously feel clarity that I didn't do any of the violence. 

All these years have gone by and it's still difficult for me, but I am in a happier place now and am working really hard to complete an education.  I don't want to sit alone with what happened anymore and my friends and dad are not equipped to handle it, nor should they be. I want to see a professional but am afraid to tell them anything.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
"My aunt assaulted me, and my family is doing absolutely nothing to help.",8,"Throwaway because I can't afford to have my family read this.

I am 16 years old, with two siblings, a mother, and a father. My mother's grandparents live with us as well as her sister and her kids. We live in the United States.

Yesterday, in the evening, I got home. I got in the dining room and heard my aunt whipping her kids with her belt in her room. I ran upstairs and asked what happened. When she didn't respond I called her a bitch for whipping her kids. Suddenly she gets up, runs to me with the belt, and hits my face with it. My brother and sister had run out of their rooms to restrain her as quickly as it happened. The right side of my face was bleeding, the right leg of my glasses was damaged, and my jaw was injured. In the past, my parents and my aunt had whipped us as punishment, which I resent. I want to file a restraining order to keep her away from me and possibly sue her so that I can pay for new glasses and the doctor, but my family is doing absolutely nothing. My father is impersonally responding to everything that I am asking him to do, and my mother keeps saying that I was disciplined. The both of them are also more concerned about what will happen to her kids than about their son. I am scared that my aunt will never have to pay a cent for what she did to me, and that incidents like these will keep happening.

Help- What do I do?,8,"I really thought I cared for him (let's call him ""T""). The highs were so high. We spent the past two days together and it was magical until it felt like a switch was hit.  

I mentioned the name of my ex in conversation (a man I dated over 8 months ago); (I started dating T about one month after my breakup).  When the name was mentioned, T asked that he let me look at me and the ex's text messages.  He became incredibly insistent, and the request turned to angry demands. At one point, I was standing at my computer and T grabbed me and physically moved me away from my computer- demanding ""let me look at them.""  He got so angry that he pounded on my cabinet in my kitchen- telling me that I'm a liar and clearly have something to hide.  The last 6 months, T and I have been dating, then off, then on again. There were times when I was communicating with my ex because i missed feeling respected in a relationship, and I missed someone to talk to who I could be myself around. 

I told T I was going to call the police if he didn't leave, he grabbed the phone from my hand and thew it, and proceeded to try and look towards my computer into my text messages. I finally got him to leave and locked the door. He then blocked me on everything.  I know I need to stay away from him, but T and I's dynamics are intoxicating.

Landlord is worse than abuser?,2,"Hi, I (22F) lived with my boyfriend (24M) for over a year after dating two and a half years. In march, he broke up with me and moved out. I asked the landlord to remove him from the lease and he never did. We started trying again, and had a good time. He then got too drunk and went into psychosis and attacked me which led to police intervention for my safety and property damage. The police determined, and took my ex‚Äôs confession, for my ex to be responsible. My landlord refused to change locks, claimed I was responsible for everything because my ex shouldn‚Äôt be living there (which I will add another point about), and claimed I could not move without lawyers involved and that he would put me in jail. My ex, who while he physically hurt me, does not want me to deal with this because I am the victim. My landlord claimed ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck about your safety, only my house‚Äù. He claimed my ex can come and go as he pleases because he‚Äôs on the lease despite being arrested for this. While taking pictures of the damage, my landlord took pictures of my personal belongings including my clothes, underwear, dishes, coffee table, and even my cat. My ex (who is being reasonable since this happened with psychosis), went to speak to my landlord about him just staying and replacing me on the lease to get me removed, and the landlord claimed I was ‚Äúacting like a woman‚Äù for being attacked and scared, and then joked asking if he was on a bad acid trip and claiming I deserved it. My ex did not agree with this and is uncomfortable because clearly his mental state is not okay to joke with. I don‚Äôt want to press charges because dealing with courts gives me anxiety and my ex agreed to go to AA and seek help, and he is showing me he is doing that. I am not going to get back together with him, but if he fixes his life I don‚Äôt want to mess it up and keep him living as the way he was to do that to someone else.

Considering pressing charges,5,"
I‚Äôm not sure where to even start or if it‚Äôs even worth reporting. Apart of me wants to report it to help prevent him from hurting others in the future but another part is super unsure if it‚Äôs worth the hassle I guess. A general summary of experiences:

- Choked multiple times, I have pictures of bruises around my neck and forearms 

- Smashed phone, completely shattering it into 2 pieces

- I went to an urgent care for X-rays of my arm when he sprained my wrist. I lied to the nurses and made up a story of how it happened instead of saying my partner had done it when he was angry so I‚Äôm not sure how that would play out.

- There‚Äôs security camera footage from his cousins house of him shoving me to the ground out of the door and most likely captured him yelling and me screaming/fighting him off of me during a time that he was choking me. I also have pictures of my busted lip from this day as well.

"I was attacked by my sister, I called the cops and they arrested me instead",5,"Hi everyone. So basically my sister and I got into a petty fight few days ago. I‚Äôm 22yrs old and live with my mom and 21yr old sister. It basically started with me knocking on the bathroom door while my sister was showering because I had to pee really bad(we only have one bathroom). Sister started yelling at me to wait after opening the door. I pee and then I leave and go back to my room. An hour later I politely go ask my sister for the Costco card(it‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs card) which she had kept. She completely ignores me. I ask her why she‚Äôs giving me an attitude for no reason. Ignores me again. I then go to my sister handbag and look for her wallet to retrieve the Costco card because I had to her groceries. She comes at me yelling telling me that I have no right to go through her stuff which I understand but we‚Äôre family and it‚Äôs not like I was stealing something. I was just looked for something she refuses to give me. So then I decided to hide my and her car keys till she gave me the card. My sister then saw that and came up to me and punched me in the head to which I reacted and hit her back. We got into a huge physical fight in which she threatened to kill me. This ended in her pinning me down on the couch and repeatedly punching my head and me trying to push her away and scratching her face. Just to give some reference she is 230lbs, almost 100lbs heavier than me. My mom heard the commotion from the other room and came to break up the fight after which I called the cops. Both mom and sister then cornered me in the room and yelled profanities in my language as I spoke to 911. After the cops came they spoke to everyone and asked everyone the story. Basically ended in the cops arresting me for simple assault because my mom told them that she saw the whole thing and that I was the aggressor and that I have a history of abuse none of which is true but my mom has always favored my sister more than me. The other reason for my arrest was because I had no physical signs of trauma but my sister had scratches on her face. 2 days later I now have bruises all over that I have documented. I did not go to the hospital at the time of the arrest because I generally felt fine. Im applying for graduate school soon and this charge will absolutely ruin my life. I dont know what to do.

Finally free from lunatic ex boyfriend! (20F - 23M) trigger warning,5,"Hey all! This is my first ever text post on Reddit. I'm just looking for some extra support as I don't have many friends irl. 

I started dating this guy in 2019 (18 y/o) and very soon after got kicked out of my previous home bc my ex still lived there (BS but I accepted it).

 He gladly took me in and I lived there for a few months while I got on my feet. During this time we got very close and started hanging out pretty much every day. We had a great connection, everyone we knew was excited for us and praised our relationship. 

While living with him I saw him argue with his family sometimes and say rude things so I asked him about it. He opened up about trauma from being adopted, ADHD, how his parents have always been too old to understand him (60 & 80y/o) bla bla bla. I definitely recognized it as a red flag, but understood why he was frustrated. 

Eventually I moved back in with my family, but we continued to hang out all the time. I've also had issues with my family, but mostly because my mom is hyper religious and the rest of them are not. He eventually started insulting my family as well, calling my mom a lunatic and her boyfriend a stuck up asshole. 

One night he was spouting off similar insults to them and I couldn't stand it anymore. After crying and asking him to stop repeatedly, he didn't, so I slapped him in the face pretty hard. He then pinned me down on the bed and punched my upper legs multiple times. He immediately apologized and comforted me saying he had no idea what came over him and that it would never happen again..... right 

Fast forward a year and his parents kick him out for being too argumentative. He claimed that since ""losing"" his family he needed even more support. I started spending more time with him than anyone else and he'd get very upset when we had days off together and I'd choose not to hang out with him. Being that it was an hour long drive to his new place, I decided to move in. 

During this time his behavior continued to escalate, but he always had excuses. I don't remember the exact reason or time when he started hitting me first, but it happened that summer. A few times I tried to flee an argument and he would tackle me to the ground or restrain me. I often escaped and hid in the woods for a couple hours. When I came back he would have cleaned the house and acted totally apologetic. 

I knew it was extreme, but my dad was abusive to my mom growing up so I somehow felt I knew how to handle it ? Don't question that logic lol.. 

Eventually we found a place closer to my job, but this time I knew the landlord and paid all the up front cost. Within two months he'd already broken two of my ribs with a single punch, kicked the same ribs a week later, stuffed blankets around my head to muffle screams, pulled me backwards down the stairs onto tile floor, and broke my nose with a headbutt. Not to mention obliterating all of my proudly thrifted dining room chairs. 

This was the straw that broke the camel's...uh.. ribs and face? I painstakingly waited another month before seeing a doctor, gathering all the evidence I could and switching things over to my name. I didn't have to wait,  but I'm juuuuust a tad bit stubborn ; ) and hate hospitals. 

Last Saturday was the last time I've seen him. Before leaving for work I packed a backpack and threw it off the balcony onto the lawn near my car so he wouldn't see me carry it out. I never went home after work and I've been staying with my mom ever since. 

The next day I went to an urgent care for confirmation that my ribs were broken and some meds to help me sleep. I now have all the evidence I need to get him removed from the property and file a relief from abuse order against him. 

I'm happy to be safe, but I have no appetite and anxiety attacks every day. If anyone has any advice to stop me from rationalizing it or reaching out to him PLEASE let me know. Right now I feel like a slug, but I know it'll get better. Thank you for reading if you've made it this far üíï",TW Physical Violence

In Touch With Abuser-Trigger Warning,11,"Hi guys,
My abuser hasn‚Äôt changed in 4.5 years. He actually sent me a text asking me why he had a lapse in getting laid. He knew I would be upset. He said he only wants me and still talks to me because he loves me. I think he wanted sex that night. He called me on the phone and when we disagreed he hung up the phone. This is the same childish behavior I saw in him when we were together. He texted me last week and asked to see me the same night and then acted like he‚Äôd never talk to me again if I didn‚Äôt jump. He plays games. He spends two days returning my text but I better return his within an hour or I‚Äôm rejecting him. He dangled marriage in front of me the other night. He said I had to convince him that I was the right person. I was like ‚Äú Yeah, that will happen!‚Äù I do love him and may still be in love with him but he refuses to change. When I say he was abusive, I mean he left me with two black eyes, bruises, emotional and psychological pain.

My (20m) younger brother (16m) attacked me.,2,"I was playing video games when he came upstairs. I asked if he wanted to play after I was done and he said yes. Then I asked him about the broken gaming headset. They‚Äôve been broken for two days and he plays everyday, so I know he knows about them. He said he had no idea they were broken and then accused me of breaking them. I told him that I knew I didn‚Äôt break them, and said that I wasn‚Äôt upset with him if he did it anyways because they‚Äôre his, but he kept accusing me and getting more aggressive. He does this often where he lies about things and then gets angry when the other person disagrees. I was trying to be really careful about the conversation and the words I used, and told him not to get ‚Äúdispleasant.‚Äù To which he swore at me and told me leave. Then he got up angrily and started walking towards me with his hands up. I squeezed the can of seltzer I was drinking in his direction (admittedly a dumb idea but I was thinking on my feet), then he punched me in the face and eye while I was sitting on the couch. I put my hands up to protect myself and then got my hands around his neck and pushed him down onto the couch, then ran away from him. I didn‚Äôt try to hurt him, I was only defending myself then I left. I have a black eye from where he hit me and a scratch along my face. He has marks on his neck from where I grabbed him. My parents just want us to ‚Äútalk it out,‚Äù some time soon, but I just don‚Äôt feel safe. He has a crazy temper, and is just as big as me, and taller by an inch even. My parents are otherwise being supportive because they know he has a temper. I just don‚Äôt know what to do, and I know they won‚Äôt do anything helpful. I feel like it just keeps getting worse and worse.

"Brother (36) lives at home with mom (66) and verbally, sometimes physically abusive",3,"I‚Äôm a first generation American born woman (29) who is in a difficult spot trying to protect my widowed mother from hurt, disappointment, stress, and violence. My mother is from India and worked hard her entire life. She came to this country on her own and worked early as a farm laborer, spent time raising my brother single handedly for several years when my father had visa issues, then my father passed in 2006 when I was 14, my sister was 16 and brother was 21.

Flash forward, my brother has continued down a bad path and has spent last 10 years in and out of jail, prison, and rehab. He and my mom have a toxic relationship. She is full of resentment, makes passive aggressive comments about my brother not working, doing drugs. He is a mostly happy and funny guy, but gets extremely angry when he doesn‚Äôt get his way. He feels a sense of entitlement where he doesn‚Äôt feel he has to work or even do basic housekeeping/cooking/cleaning- nothing. Clearly things have been this way for some time.

It‚Äôs now at the point where he yells and even throws things and has on occasion aggressively grabbed my moms arm to get money. 

I left home and went away to college and always envisioned living in a big city, but came home because my mom had cancer and needed help. I want to help her, and tried talking to my brother. He‚Äôs made false promises saying he would get his license and get a job as soon as he got out of rehab.

Anyone else feel this way after an abusive situation?,7,"I was wrongfully charged in 2019 while trying to defend myself against my abuser. He had me by my throat against a wall, and so I bit him so he would release me. Stupidly, I bit him pretty hard and I left a pretty good mark, and the marks he had left on me, sadly had disappeared by the time police got there. I was then arrested and charged with assault. Now, my abuser had gotten my charges dropped, basically because he was still trying to keep me in his life, and around him. He would always threaten to kill my cats, he'd threaten to throw them outside so I'd never see them again, threaten to throw me out of the apartment, etc. One day, he had pinned me and started spitting repeatedly in my face, screaming at me, saying I was worthless, so I had him charged. I wasn't going to drop the charges but he started texting me from an unknown number, saying how sorry he was, that it would never happen again, basically anything he could to get me to drop the charges and come back to him. Sadly, it worked. I dropped his charges and went back to him. Also, this was BEFORE he had me charged for assault. Anyways, fast forward a bit, I end up getting him charged a second time for overcoming resistance (he had me in a chokehold) and this time, I do not drop his charges. He gets charged with assault x2 and overcoming resistance x1. He goes to court, ALL HE GETS IS A 12 MONTH PEACE BOND. On top of this, he was constantly contacting me while we had a no contact order in place. So, I went to police and he was charged with a breach. ALL HE GOT WAS A $400 FINE. And both times he was charged, he was on probation for ANOTHER assault against an ENTIRELY different person. 

Well, fast forward to now and because I was charged, I now can't work with children because my vulnerable sector check shows I was charged. And even though that doesn't mean I have a criminal record, which I don't. I feel like I'm getting punished because I defended myself against someone who once told me they loved me. Also, when he was convicted he lived 3 hours away from me in a whole other city. Now, I found out he lives in my city within a 10 mile radius. I refuse to get a job here, I refuse to leave my home alone, I refuse to walk around the area. I am terrified I will run into him again and he will hurt me. 

I guess what I want to know is, am I the only one who feels failed by the justice system? Does any other victim feel they were wronged or the justice system didn't do enough? I always feel so alone when it comes to everything surrounding the abuse I went through, I'm scared of my own feelings now because I think theyre wrong, or unimportant.

Still struggling 3 years later,2,"TW: Physical abuse from parents, Physical abuse from SO

After experiencing abuse from both my parents separately (both have different problems) I kinda lock up and go empty when someone verbally/physically abuses me. 

My(24M) ex(27F) would freak out and throw fists at me, but because of our difference in height/weight, she really didn't do any more damage than a child throwing a tantrum could. When it happened though it destroyed me mentally, and left me suicidal in a town where I knew nobody really and scared to talk to her about anything. (I'd moved north with her to be closer to her parents)

I ended up leaving, only letting her know once I'd packed up and was on the journey home. I hated it. It was the worse feeling and i kept reliving that day and how I'd left her again and again. I cant shake the feeling that if I'd just been the bigger person and tried harder to sort things out than it could have been different. She had her own demons and she wasnt a bad person. Writing this I know that I did as much as possible but it keeps me up at night. I want to talk about it with her but I also want to let her get on with her life. 

Im in a rough situation now but thankfully I'm safe, I should probably get therapy for this and i have a partner now who loves me and treats me well, I'm just not sure how to get past this.

I left because of DV. He was arrested, but all charges were dropped due to lack of evidence and I was denied a protection order twice.

Why do I keep getting into abusive relationships?,9," Note: sorry this is poorly written and jumbled. Writing it all down was stressful and I don't want to reread or rewrite it. Just let me know if something doesn't make sense :)   
 

Wednesday evening, I had a huge fight with my partner (basically, he was angry that I now work with a guy I once slept with) and he hit me. That was the fourth time he has hit me, but the first time in almost two years. I am still sort of in shock. No, I'm not staying with him right now, I am staying with my sister. Even though it is stupid to be surprised, because he's done it before, I really am. And I feel hurt and betrayed and mostly just so fucking stupid. He's not the first partner I've had that was abusive and honestly at this point the only common denominator is me.   
 

My stepfather abused me sexually as a teen. From sometime in seventh grade until my mom divorced him when I was 16. I think this is why I am fucked up like I am. I didn't date until I was in my twenties because of the guilt and disgust I had regarding this. For some reason when I did become sexually active as an adult I could only be that way with strangers and hookups, and I felt shy otherwise. I thought someone I cared about would be disgusted with me if they saw me in a sexual context.   
 

My first serious boyfriend was an addict (like I was at the time). He would be super aggressive and scream in my face, corner me and tell me he was going to kill me, rip out my hair, threaten me with belts and once a lighter and can of spray deodorant. The last time I saw him he spit right in my face and told me he hoped my aunt (who is battling cancer) dies hating me. But other times he was ridiculously loving and affectionate. He bombarded me with apologies and compliments and presents and wanted to be with me 24/7. I rarely went a waking hour without seeing or hearing from him during that time. It's obvious now all the times he was sweet was just a way for him to get me to stay through the shitty times. But I was young and lonely and stupid at the time, so I fell for it.   
 

My current/ex partner is my only other serious relationship, and he is the exact opposite. He isn't aggressive (typically) or affectionate. He is bossy, and he is great at making you feel stupid without saying it. Every argument and disagreement ends with me feeling like a moron. I'm always wrong with him. I even apologized the first three times he hit me, because he somehow convinced me it was my fault. Everytime we had a fight, he would condescend me and minimize me, and then when I got angry or yelled I was too aggressive and blowing up over nothing. When I cried I was too sensitive and freaked out over everything. Even writing this, knowing it is true, I somehow feel like I am lying. Or that there is some context to this that I don't know yet which will explain everything and show how actually I am a stupid overly sensitive moron. But he hit me, which isn;t right even if I was yelling. I wasn't threatening him or cornering him or anything, so he had no right. And the next thing he said was, ‚ÄúLook what you've done.‚Äù Like I forced him to do it or something.   
 

I just don't see why all these things happen to me. If it was just my stepdad, or just my partner, that would be a coincidence, but at this point it has to be me. What can I possibly be doing that says I'm an easy target? Is it something I can fix? I want to be better but at this point I don't think relationships are for me.

I fucked up and snuck my FWB (19M) over to my house while my parents were out. He spent the night and we had a great time. In the morning we slept for a while and it was around 10am and we were still in the bed. My mother knocks on the door and I make up an excuse to not immediately answer the door as I hide 19M in my closet. She comes in and is looking around my room for trash to throw, Then she opens up the closet and sees 19M standing there. This has been the second time i‚Äôve been caught doing this (not proud of it, but hey i‚Äôm a adult who wants my own independence).  She starts yelling and my dad comes behind her, that‚Äôs where hell breaks loose. I disassociated in this situation so i don‚Äôt remember it so well, but my brother also came in behind them. 19M was instructed to go downstairs i‚Äôm so happy they didn‚Äôt hit him, but I remember taking all the blame for it verbally, my dad hitting me on my head and back , I was crying, bawling, I ended up fighting him back and trying to kick him and my brother and mother held him back from me. I don‚Äôt think as a 19F this is acceptable behavior coming from a older man to me no matter what the circumstance is so I called the police as my brother, who was abused as a child too and gaslighted like me, called me a snitch. They tried hanging the phone up but i told officers to come. I ended up walking to my nearby park as my mother and brother went on the boys family front lawn and called them white trash and yelled at their parents. I was walking by crying and my mom ended up meeting me at the park and waiting for officers with me. This just got so out of hand. I am now homeless, the boys family was nice enough to let me stay for a couple days and now I am staying at my friends house. She spoke to my mom to let her know where I was because I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone. No one has reached out to me i guess i‚Äôm the black sheep of the family now.  I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to come out of this with the law but i am trying to stay in the present and stay positive... My friends mom told my parents are in distress right now which makes me extremely sad but i‚Äôm trying not to focus on them and just focus on me... what do you guys think?   


I have also been through abuse like this my whole life and I am on antidepressants from the trauma. I‚Äôm the only one out of my family who chooses to go to therapy for my issues and take medication. I am a college student and a babysitter.

am i in a slowly escalating abusive relationship,12,"my boyfriend hurt me today. i was jokingly making fun of him and he ran towards me and started chocking me, I thought it was a joke but it really started to hurt so i tried to say this actually hurts and then he let go of me. after I told him it actually hurt he blamed me and said I should be careful of what I say. it sounds like he was threathening me and this has happened before, he has said stuff like I should not make him mad and I should be careful. he gets mad and punches the walls sometimes and Im kind of scared by this. he talks about his anger and how he kind of understands people even killing someone because of anger. he says his anger can take control of him and that it could get to a point where he doesnt controll it anymore.

Sister is Victim of Abuse and won't Leave Him,7,"Please excuse any shortcomings I have as I've never used reddit before. I decided to try telling this story and asking reddit after reading some posts from others. I think this is the right place.

**Background:**

My (29m) sister (25f) is in a relationship with BF (26?m) she originally met at work. Our mother also worked there for a time, so she has a bit more personal knowledge about him compared to me. Basically, it boils down to a lot of what I'm about to write here being secondhand explanations.

For most of our youth, it was always my sister, mother, and I that spent a lot of time together. My stepdad (sister's father) was around but spent a lot of time at work and such. Not exactly neglectful, but also not exactly there all the time either. It was apparently such a common sight that the three of us were together for sports, school functions, etc that our grandparents (mom's side) referred in jest to us as the Three Musketeers.

I won't say that my sister and I have always had the best relationship, which sounds clich√© perhaps. I struggled a bit in my early-mid teens with my father's absence and unfortunately took some of that out on her in various ways that I do regret to this day. Because of that, I feel she likewise pushed me away in her teens when I was trying to reconcile with the damage to our relationship I'd caused. There was a point where it seemed like we had come to at least an mutual understanding that we were going to leave the past behind and build something new for the future, especially when stepdad left just after she graduated high school.

I admit that maybe I complicated things a bit more in our relationship when I rather suddenly moved out in the span of a week just after Christmas 2018. That was mostly due to an argument I had with both of sister and mom one evening a just a couple weeks before and perhaps overreacted on my part. Of course, that wasn't the only factor that contributed to that decision, but that's another story. The point is, it strained communication with my sister even more than it had been as of late. She and I would barely talk, even through text or whenever we passed in person.

Back to the BF. From what I know and remember, he joined the place that mom and sister worked at some point in 2018 (I think). For reference, mom and sister both work emergency medicine and it was a close place that paid well with their license. Mom never had the best impression of him, but she is very detail oriented and thorough at work, but knowing her nature admittedly left a poor impression of him on me despite never having met the guy. Eventually, at some point I believe around early-mid 2019, my sister and BF started dating. They eventually moved in together, something I didn't really didn't think she would do, but not being at home, not really talking, and not being demanding I didn't really care that much.

BF had not done a lot to ingratiate himself with mom since sister had started dating him, not that he's obligated to. Our grandparents met him at one point, and they later told me that he didn't make a great impression on them either, something sister criticized them for when she later asked what they thought and they were honest. I finally truly met BF for the first time in 2019 during what had become over the last few years sister and I's annual convention trip when he joined us. I suppose I should mention stepdad came on this trip too, and was also the first time he had met BF. Stepdad had a more favorable impression of him, but I didn't. Maybe that was from hearing a lot about him from mom and grandparents first, but I was trying really hard to focus on judging him for myself from what I saw.

Oh, I should also mention that in fall 2020, while we were having a birthday celebration for sister, BF dropped the word fianc√©, which I picked up on and noticed sister's reaction to being stated. However, mom and grandparents who were also there didn't react so I thought maybe I'd misheard (I am partially deaf). Mom confirmed after dinner that I hadn't misheard when I asked her about it, saying sister had only told her the week before. BF posted about it on social media, but sister did not, which looking back should have maybe been a sign. BF apparently got upset that no one reacted at dinner, since he had intentionally slipped that in, but dropped it when mom told him that no one else had known since sister hadn't told me or grandparents.

&#x200B;

Now, keep in mind, everything I'm about to say is secondhand unless otherwise stated.

**The First Event:**

So with the lockdowns in 2020 a lot went on. I ended up back home with mom in the fall. Sister had moved with BF to an apartment during the summer, but they had previously been in his parent's basement. The apartment is maybe 15-20 minutes away mom and I.

About 3-4 days before Christmas 2020, mom gets a call at about 3am from sister, saying that BF had hurt her. Mom rushed over, but didn't grab me before, which probably is for the best. I don't typically consider myself a violent person, though I can get quite angry, but I probably would have done something terrible in hindsight that night had I gone.

BF and sister were not fighting at the time mom arrived at their apartment, and so mom managed to remove him from the apartment and talk about the situation. Sister had apparently also contacted several other people, but only one Friend (25?m) had likewise rushed over to help. BF, on returning to the apartment, went into a rage and attacked Friend, which mom tried to intervene in. The three of them fell to the ground and Friend's leg got broken at some point in the process. Apparently Friend was the superior fighter that night, and managed to subdue and restrain BF until the cops showed up. Fortunately mom wasn't injured during the whole thing. Cops did their investigation, took pics, and all that. Sister's neck had literal bruises from where BF had put his hands on her. Needless to say, BF was hauled off to local jail that morning, where he stayed through Christmas and a couple more days.

Sister was rightfully traumatized by everything that occurred, and mom stayed with her at the apartment for several hours that morning. BF was fired from the mutual workplace in the following days. Sister followed the police advice and got a temporary restraining order/no contact order immediately. I'm not certain what that did though, since the initial temporary one expired before he was out of jail, but whatever. She apparently followed up on it though with a more permanent one afterwards, so we were relieved to a degree. Naturally, I think we all thought at that point sister and BF were done. How wrong we were.

**The Second Event:**

Mom had taken to routinely passing by the apartment at least once a week to check on sister since the First Event. She didn't necessarily stop in or talk to sister, it was more to keep watch for BF. About 2 months after First, mom saw his car in the apartment's lot.

I got the call around 8pm from mom as she was rightly panicking. The no-contact/restraining order was supposed to be in place, why is he there? I grabbed the spare apartment key mom had and rushed over myself. I called grandparents on my way (I know, traffic laws might have something to say about that) and told them what was going on just in case something went down. Grandfather decided to come as well, just in case. Additionally, a friend and coworker of mom's, I'll call him Doc here, came when she called him, since Doc had put sister in touch with a lawyer.

For about the next two hours, the four of us (Doc, mom, grandfather, and me) were kind of like sharks circling the apartment. Mom ending up running over to the nearby police station and had them do a welfare check on sister to make sure things were okay. Unfortunately, they were good. As such, there was nothing any of us could do, so we left. On the way home, I ended up calling stepdad (I know, again) and told him about both events. He was unaware, which didn't surprise me really since sister likes talking to her father almost as much as she likes talking to me anymore.

Turns out that a week or so before this, sister had gone to the court and had the order revoked, so BF wasn't in violation. I'm really not sure how BF convinced her to revoke it so they could talk when he shouldn't have been in contact. But she never told anyone, so she would later text mom saying something along the lines of 'that blew up in my face' because she was thinking about how to tell mom about this but hadn't yet.

**Fallout:**

Well, over the next several weeks, at least mom and I were a bit sleepless with worry. Maybe it's from watching too many crime dramas over the years, maybe it's because of hearing stories like this, but I think we are both fearing that we are going to get a call or a knock on the door from a cop telling us that sister is dead. It's still not easy and I'm praying every night that something changes here.

Sister has refused to go to any sort of therapy and is blaming us for not supporting her decisions about all this. They supposedly called off the engagement back in January 2021, but apparently they are back on. She was always a social butterfly type of person, but we think BF has convinced her now that she has social anxiety about talking to anyone and everyone and is depressed. She's already gotten prescribed anti-depressants, which I personally think she should have had some kind of evaluation or mandated therapy before getting but it is what it is.

BF was put on trial by the state, but apparently sister's testimony was what the entire case was hinged upon and she refused to. Clarification, she wanted to change her story from what she gave the cops on the night of First Event, and so plead the 5th as to not perjure herself in court. With that alone, nothing is sticking to BF. Apparently if she changes her mind within a year and testifies, the state can still go after him, but that's looking less and less likely. There is still a case between BF and Friend that is still pending because of the broken leg, which mom is going to testify at, which may get BF on a felony assault charge.

&#x200B;

**Other Thoughts and Advice Questions:**

I'm not really sure what it is I'm looking for when it comes to advice here. A friend I've talked to has mentioned getting therapy for myself, but I'm the actual social recluse between my sister and I, so I'm not sure. I've been planning to meet with another friend who is a social worker to get her more in-depth thoughts about everything. I guess is there anything else you all might suggest trying or doing for myself?

I ended up getting upset with my mom about a week ago about all this. I feel like all of us are trying to pretend that nothing is wrong when sister is around so as not to scare her off or make her push us even further away. I said in that moment that part of me just wants to unload all of my thoughts and feelings about this to my sister and if she cuts me off, then it's on her. I want to be there for her, but I'm also tired of keeping up this charade when every time I see her now I'm left wondering if it will be the last time I see her alive. I know that unleashing that kind of rant would likely be counterproductive, but I don't know what to do otherwise when we barely speak or do anything together anymore. Mom mentioned that she's trying hard to subtly remind sister that she has value beyond what BF is attributing to her. What can I say that can help sister realize this when she won't listen to me, other family, or even 99% of her friends?

BF has sister so warped and confused that she feels guilty for the whole thing. She feels like she 'overreacted' and 'it wasn't that bad actually.' It was her anxiety and depression (not saying she couldn't develop those, but she didn't have them before BF convinced her she had them) that made her react that way at during the First Event. All classic abuser techniques, I know.

Apparently BF is also trying to convince sister that they should get a house now, which would only create more complex ties to him. I fear that by year's end, at this rate, I'm going to be an uncle and will have another person that I will worry about being around this guy. BF is such a textbook case of abuse that it's like he's following a Google search on how to do it (I've done a few to check that I'm not making it up).

I know I'm not a saint in my past relationship with my sister, but I don't want to lose her. I feel like a failure since I'm not able to be the protective older brother that I hoped I could be either before or during this type of situation (hence the throwaway username). Am I exaggerating this feeling?

I'll try to give updates when I get information and answer any questions as best I can. Thank you in advance for any advice you might have to offer.

TL;DR Sister is an abuse victim and doesn't see it as such despite family and most friends telling her it is, is still with abusive BF.",TW Physical Violence
Filed a restraining order petition today for doemstic violence,5,"I was living with my gf and she was very abusive verbally, and had issues with alcohol. I tried to be supportive and was always empathetic to her through her alcohol issues.
Slowly it turned into threats of violence and I still felt things could improve..

It then became physically abusive, I still thought that I should be supportive through her substance abuse issues but I started recording our phone calls and saving our text messages... Till it became really bad on a vacation which ended up with cops arresting her for domestic violence given the injuries to me it was pretty obvious.

I had to bail her out since no one else would and then we came back home and talked about her moving out since I was the tenant and she was an occupant. She again started drinking at home and threatened me. I left immediately and started staying in a hotel and got a lawyer since my capacity to accepting physical abuse was over.

The lawyer went through the recordings and the text messages and given how clear things were based on those, according to the lawyer the recordings and the text messages will be invaluable. She even threatened to lie about what happened and put it on me, that too got recorded.

At this point I feel paralyzed being alone in the same home when she gets drunk and starts abusing me verbally and eventually becoming a physical abuse.

I filed the petition for a restraining order today, despite being physically abused multiple times, I still feel empty for doing this. Since we live together if the restraining order is granted (very likely given the amount of evidence), she will be pushed out of the home and knowing her financial situation I don't know what she will go through. After all the verbal and physical abuse, I still can't seem to shake the feeling of feeling empty for doing this to another human being. I am not sure what I am supposed to feel like... Just wanted to get this off my chest.

Lesson: please record things on your phone, it's very very helpful.

"I escaped, what do i do about his new victims?",5,"TLDR; My abusive ex has hurt someone else and is going to trial on a Domestic Assault - 2nd Degree charge in Oct. 2021. Do I call the prosecutor to help ?



 I left Memorial Day weekend 2017 and with the help of friends and family went no contact since late 2017, but still tried to talk to his parents as my children love their grandparents. He crashed their car tried to burn their house down so they said ""this was the last straw"" and cut him off in late 2017. 

During this time he got married and divorced in a month, moved to another state for another short lived relationship, and dated 2 more girls in our home city. Every relationship seemed to end on bad terms, but nothing was ever filed in court. Our children have seen their grandparents, and aside from them sneaking him around them once,  have not seen him since 2017.

FF>> Its Christmas 2020, the grandparents are begging me to come up, saying ""stop worrying about COVID"" since July. Suddenly, they stop asking us about visiting, then stop calling altogether. I started to get a bad feeling about this, as I assumed this meant they were back in contact with their son and knew I'd be upset. I look on our local case lookup site, and I find out on 12/30 he committed 2nd degree assault and is on house arrest at their address. It seems pretty bad, but also seems like exactly what he has done to me so I believe every word. I am compelled to help the court, this isnt the first time he has hurt someone and it wont be the last. He forced me to recant and his parents usually pay his way out of it and I want him to actually serve time and I dont want him to hurt anyone else. Do I thank god i escaped and let the events play out? Do I call the prosecutor and tell her this is a pattern of behavior?

Trying to leave my abuser once and for all.,1,"My ex boyfriend has been physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive for 8-9 months of our relationship. At first i saw all the red flags. The excessive projection, blaming me and everyone around him for his circumstances. Love bombing me and idealizing me then devaluing me. Trying to control me and when he realized he couldn‚Äôt he would project, say I was cheating on him, a liar, my boundaries made me suspicious, untrustworthy and toxic. He would call me delusional, mental, crazy, worthless and a horrible human if he felt he was being abandoned or rejected by me. I couldn‚Äôt hang out with any of my friends. He saw them all as a threat. If anyone flirted with me he would lash out on me and say I was doing it for attention. If I wore clothing too revealing he‚Äôd say I was asking for it. 


He wanted me to only depend on him. Once I did and became codependent, he said I was smothering him. He felt trapped and like he couldn‚Äôt do anything with his life. He started to become shady and speaking to other women trying to find a way out of the relationship. I confronted him about it but he would call me paranoid, delusional and obsessed.

Whenever he was angry he would say hurtful things. Gaslight me and deny everything and anything. He would take my phone as a means of control and when I took his back out of retaliation cause I was tired of him treating me that way, it gave him an excuse to punch me.

I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit, please let me know if there is a better one I can cross post to. 




I left a sexually abusive relationship at the end of December and went with my roommates to pick up my stuff from my abusers house in January. This is the last time I saw him in person. I blocked him on everything since then.

In may, he made an Instagram account, posted photos of just him from a trip we went on just the two of us. Follow requested me on both my accounts, I promptly blocked him. I filed a police report the next day because I had already put that off for long enough.

I met up with a friend this week and the friend told me that my abuser asked if I filed a police report and they said yes. They are giving me no other information. 

Now that my abuser knows about the police report, I am worried for my safety. I live an hour away but the abuser has been to my house twice in the past year (may 2020-sept 2020) and also know where to find it as it is right next to a specific business.

Another reason I am worried is because he is not very mentally stable, and talked a lot about wanting to own a firearm. Specifically wanting to move to Texas so that if someone said something Xphobic or trespassed on his property, he could ‚Äúblow their fucking brains out‚Äù, and avoiding getting a medicinal marijuana card so that he could purchase a firearm.  

I want to get a Protection order of some sort, but my main worry is how he will react especially if it does not get approved. I‚Äôm worried since it has been so long since we saw each other in person, and with the hour distance between us it will not get approved.

My wife has started abusing again.,18,"I have never posted about this before, and I don‚Äôt know who to talk to. Or what to do. 

Back story: my wife and I have been married for 9 years. When we first got married we had a very rocky start. Not only was she verbally abusive, she was physically abusive, and she was extremely suicidal. We had the cops called several times and it would usually just resolve it there and the cops would leave. I didn‚Äôt know how to handle things and I didn‚Äôt know who to talk to. So I just lived with the abuse, until one night she OD‚Äôd on sleeping pills. I rushed her to the ER where they saved her and sent her to 2 months in a psych ward. There she was diagnosed and medicated. In addition to that she started seeing a therapist and things got a lot better. She was still abusive verbally and the periods between physical abuse grew larger and larger. Therapy continued working and the periods of verbal abuse got wider and wider until it tapered off to no more abuse.

The past few months: over the past few months instances of verbal abuse have sparked up again. Lots of swearing, yelling, and name calling. Relatively benign things sending her over the edge into enormous explosions. Lots of demeaning name calling, coupled with suicidal ideation. But it‚Äôs almost like she is using her diagnosis as an absolvement for her actions. Ie ‚ÄúSorry I flew off the handle and screamed at you for an hour, I‚Äôm just really stressed, I‚Äôm just going to kill myself to protect you‚Äù kind of stuff. Then a few weeks ago the physical abuse started up again. It started as just throwing whatever was in her hand at me when she was mad, then evolved into slapping, and then tonight she punched me in the face. 
I‚Äôm so fucking embarrassed writing this. I don‚Äôt know what else to do though. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to and I‚Äôm terrified that she is going back to the way she was when we first got married. I‚Äôm so angry and hurt. Plus to make matters worse I am afraid that no one will give a fuck. I‚Äôm a big ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù kind of guy. I‚Äôm well educated and I work a job that pays well and I can‚Äôt imagine my coworkers finding out that I get beat by my little wife. My wife is great at playing the sensitive and kind friend. I feel like even if I told anyone irl they wouldn‚Äôt believe me. And to make matters even more complicated I know she can be good. She went YEARS without abusing. I don‚Äôt understand the relapse and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I guess thanks for reading this.  Just lettting me have a place to get it out.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
What are the signs the guy you're seeing plans to kill you?,6,"Because I have the feeling the man I'm involved with wants to kill me... I'm posting from another account to be careful, but basically, I posted here about it some time ago (on another account), and people kept telling me to stay safe because he might kill me. (He is much older and said he'll strangle and beat me, is extremely controlling, jealous, tried to hack me, etc.) 

Anyway. I tried to cut him off, but I have trouble leaving him. We are still ""friends,"" and we're talking here and there, and he tries to be friendly and interested, but I can't let go of this odd feeling that I'm being watched by him (on social media) and that he might ask friends to keep tabs on me. I even noticed he has been close to another woman who has been treating me really badly whenever I saw her and flirting heavily with him, throwing jabs at me, etc. Yet he is the one who loses his mind whenever another guy talks to me (whereas he doesn't seem to mind with her). 

This is important to the story because suddenly, I'm getting suspicions that he might have badmouthed me to her, manipulating her so if something happens to me, they won't suspect him. 

Even now, after all, it seems as though he is angry at me. He will talk down to me, act like I'm a kid and he needs to explain everything to me, act so superior and controlling, like he needs to spend time with me, but I just can't shake this feeling off that he despises me. It's the oddest situation. 

I'm so uncomfortable because, in a weird way, I'm a bit afraid to cut him off. Like he will try to ruin me or my reputation. At the same time, I want to be with him sometimes. I'm conflicted.

But worst of all: People keep telling me I'm in danger. Sorry, this was a bit vague.

Black eye/boyfriend arrested/sad gal,7,"
Hi all. I don‚Äôt usually post, but I‚Äôm spiraling a bit and just need some feedback. 

My boyfriend got arrested this weekend for domestic violence. Long story short - he was very intoxicated and blacked my eye. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do but call 911. I could tell it was only going to get worse. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. 

We haven‚Äôt spoken since. I pass by his house on my way to work and notice his vehicle hasn‚Äôt moved.. and I‚Äôm strangely worried about him still being in jail? 

(He‚Äôs most likely not. We live in Mississippi and a lot of the cops are ‚Äúgood ol boys‚Äù that he‚Äôs friends with.)

I didn‚Äôt press charges or anything.. I don‚Äôt even know how to go about that or if I should. I still love him but I‚Äôm very much on the fence of being worried about him/being sad it happened/being sad we haven‚Äôt talked and then looking at my face/broken things and getting pissed.

1. Is he going to be punished?
2. Should I feel bad in any way for calling 911?
3. What would you do in my situation? (Willing to provide more context if needed)

I just don‚Äôt know what to do.,2,"I‚Äôm at a complete loss, I feel like he has taken a piece of my soul.

The ordeal started last year. I had been hanging out with and hooking up with him for about a year prior. 

I missed a gigantic red flag because the 2nd or 3rd time we slept together, he was so rough that I had to go to the hospital and have one of the most painful operations there is (according to Google). 

I chalked it up to him accidentally being rough and was embarrassed and didn‚Äôt say anything. 

Fast forward to February of this year. I had become addicted to the painkillers I was given for the operation and was doing really badly. He came out to help and stayed with me for 2 weeks. He was completely fine. 

I got better to the point I went to visit family. He went to visit a friend. I came back and he didn‚Äôt, and when I called him to see where he was, he blocked me. 

I had a bad feeling and went to look for him; I found him overdosed and blue and Narcanned him. 

We agreed he would go to a state funded rehab center. He went for a month and came out. I noticed he was somewhat cold and something was off. 

He wanted to go to another state to get stuff from a family member. I booked a flight, and we flew there. 

He started relapsing the second day. He began hitting me, sometimes in front of his 8 year old sister. He locked me in a room and would disappear for 8+ hours at a time with no explanation. 

He tried to take me across an international border but failed because of the wrong documents. He also forcibly tattooed me, I now have a tattoo on my wrist with some writing I don‚Äôt know the significance of.  

Eventually I was able to convince him to drive back to our home state. 

We started driving, and he was driving extremely intoxicated. He was weaving and swerving. We pulled into a rest stop and he fell asleep for 4 hours. Every time I tried to wake him, he would hit me. 

I managed to escape and walked 6 miles in the middle of the night. I returned to my home and everything was fine for about a week. 

I noticed some fraud charges on my account and went to the bank to get a new card. 

When I came back, he tried to break into my house with me in it. He was belligerently drunk and, it turned out, had crashed his car into a neighbor‚Äôs house and totalled it and ran. 

He was demanding I hide him. I let him in, and we went to bed. I woke up with him choking me, spitting on me. He raped me violently and then fell asleep, and left the next day. 

I‚Äôve been to the police and filed charges. He has been in the area recently and posted selfies to Facebook, he looks terrible and sunken up. 

I feel like he‚Äôs taken part of my soul. I want him back, but I also hate him.  I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

As a result of the addiction, I‚Äôm on a medication which is giving me horrible side effects. I‚Äôm really suffering and my quality of life is really bad. I just want to live again. I feel like I have no self worth, and no one understands me.

What to do..,11,"Let me preface this by saying that I grew up in a household where I repeatedly watched my mother be physically abused.

Fast forward, I‚Äôm 30 years old and engaged. The first red flag came when his car overheated and he proceeded to freak out and punch the steering wheel over and over, very hard.

I married him anyway, and in the last 18 years, he has broken countless computers, phones, remotes, and TVs. He broke our dining room table, 2 coffee tables, and two buffets. A couple of weeks ago, he threw a side table through our dining room chandelier, shattering it. There are countless holes in my walls so I have to hang pictures in weird places to cover them. He has also hit me one time 7 years ago. When I tell him to knock it off, he screams at me to shut the fuck up, like I‚Äôm the one doing something wrong.

I think because of my upbringing, I believed it was no big deal because he wasn‚Äôt knocking me down on a regular basis. I wasn‚Äôt getting drug down the hall with an extension cord around my neck. It never occurred to me that DV comes in many forms.

Because of his behavior, I no longer love him; I‚Äôm disgusted by him. Even as I write this, he‚Äôs throwing a fit because the lawn mower won‚Äôt start. I want out so bad but I‚Äôm on disability and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll make it. All I do is stay in bed. I have ptsd from my upbringing, and he keeps me in constant fight-or-flight.

I Don't Think They're Sorry (Should I Leave?),8,"I'm a 36 year old male and my wife is 32 and diagnosed bipolar I. We have been married for two years and have dated for ten years prior.

I have decided to move out and see how things go with my wife while I work on codependency. I've been having emotional & physical numbness and trust issues with almost everybody I know. My social circle is very small. My wife, father, mother, sister and best friend are all the people I have in my life on a frequent basis but the relationships with my family is toxic.

My wife and I have had a past that's included insults, asking me to have an open relationship with other men, cold shoulders, insults in front of family members and physical attacks to name some of the things I've went through. She's forgotten most of it. Maybe she forgot it due to her bipolar. I wish I could forget.

I've been reading online about ""changes"" an abuser can make found here: [https://www.thehotline.org/resources/is-change-possible-in-an-abuser/](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/is-change-possible-in-an-abuser/)

There are steps provided here that I feel like aren't being met, specifically ""Accepting the consequences of their actions (and not blaming)."" I'm looking to see if people agree as I'm in a dark, foggy place and have no idea if I am right or my trust issues from the abuse are to blame.

She had texted and asked if I could come by and check on a dog that we had gotten just before I moved out. I remember her telling me that I could come by whenever I needed and that she was worried the puppy being by himself. We hadn't talked for two days and I couldn't remember when she was off, so I swung by to make sure that he was okay and I caught her as she had just pulled up. I asked her if she had gotten my text from a few hours ago because I didn't just want to swing by unannounced, although she had told me in the past that she was ""right down the street"" if I was having a hard time. ""Me and Chase have been out all day."" She told me as we walked up and into the apartment.

The last time she hit me (and the ""reason"" I left), occurred after she had woken me up and I was laying in bed. She told me about how she made a bag for Chase. After that she asked me ""why I didn't put the towels in the washer last night"" to which I replied that she didn't tell me to. She got defensive and I said ""Oh, well I guess I didn't hear you."" Before I knew it she was punching me while I laid in bed. I wasn't hurt at all but the vulnerability of laying in bed and unable to defend myself really hit me hard.

We had somehow gotten on the conversation of that attack again. I told her that I haven't been able to feel, other than crying when I thought of her and she told me that was to be expected of a victim of abuse. She never said sorry or consoled me. When I asked if she brought it up in her individual therapy she said that she ""brought it up"" and left it at that. I mentioned about some steps I read about online on recovery steps to recover as an abuser and that I thought it was important to focus on that as well as our couples therapy.

She explained that she hadn't taken care of herself the morning of the attack and started to go on about how I was ""cranky"" that morning. I told her I didn't want to hear my involvement and it lead into an argument. Ultimately she asked for the apartment key back and asked that I didn't just ""show up unannounced"" (although I was swinging by to check on ""our"" dog). I feel like it's just another power play.

I escaped a toxic relationship,20,"So this guy, (22)M and I, (20)F had been together for almost 3 years. At first I thought he was too good to be true, until a few months later he started to get really controlling, not letting me dress up, do makeup, or talk to my friends. He went into my phone, changed all my social media passwords and always made sure I hadn't logged into them. I was 17, about to turn 18. 

I ignored these red flags because I figured maybe it was something I was doing. He has trust issues because of his exes and I did too so I let it slide. Then one time we were in a heated argument and he slapped me in the mouth... I was in utter shock and didn't know what to say so I shut my mouth and listened to him. I wish I had walked out then and there.. but I let it slide again.
Next thing I knew, it started happening on a regular basis. He hit me upside the head, slapped me while I was driving, threw food on me after we had just gotten out of the drive through, he picked me up and threw me across the room.
He was emotionally and verbally abusive as well. Saying things like I deserve to be hit, that I dressed like a whore, and making fun of every single insecurity I have.. He alienated me from the outside world and eventually I was confined to the four walls of our bedroom. There was even a comforter over the window so I barely knew when it was day or night. He would leave me in there for hours and hours on end yet never let me leave the apartment or go to the bathroom on my own. 
However, I got used to this. I became comfortable and ""safe"" in this environment. Despite everyone telling me to, I didnt want to leave.. I had convinced myself that I was happy. 

But things started adding up I guess. So one morning while he was asleep I quietly packed a backpack, grabbed my dog and high tailed it to my car. I felt so sad driving away.. 

Its been a couple weeks now. Its my 20th birthday today, and I've been staying with my sister. I still feel so uncomfortable in this new environment that I get physically sick.

I told a friend today and she told me that the fact that I defecated was incredibly scary and probably meant that I was close to death. That realization scared me so bad.

Abuser has decided to move.... should I still move?,8,"Abuser is flatmate. I'm not the primary target, but he is mildly abusing me too and of course I have a front seat to his verbal abuse to his ex.

looking for support,8,"last night i left my abusive partner for good, his delusional drunk states, telling me i have slept with others in his house every time i go inside to use the washroom, accusing me of doing drugs when i hadn‚Äôt, i truly believe that he convinces himself of these things when he‚Äôs drunk and has a personality disorder. when i finally had enough and went to leave out the door, he cornered me (literally in a corner) and began to cut his throat with a bread knife, somehow cutting my hand in the process. (it all seemed so fast i don‚Äôt even remember seeing him with a knife) 

i can‚Äôt tell my parents because they will hate me for going to see this man after all he has put me through. i spent all night talking to police and then drove myself to the hospital to get stitches on my hand the next day. he was holding me physically against my will every time i tried to leave and then when a friend came to help me he resorted to cutting his throat.

Does this come from her abuse?,4,"My sister was in an abusive (physical and mental) relationship for 4 years. The abuse started after they hit the 1 year mark and my family and I didn‚Äôt know about it until 2 years later. She never flinched once around him or showed any signs that she was going through it. Or at least we didn‚Äôt pay attention enough to see it. After the 2 year mark, she started being aggressive with everyone, especially the boys. Not in a serious way! Just when our friends and I would make jokes and laugh to mess with her, she would slap/punch us (not in the face of course) and sometimes it would seriously hurt. Now when she did get upset at someone, it was 10x worse. She would leave bruises or scratches on people or wherever she hit them would hurt for days. It was really annoying at times and I yelled at her about it one time and she started crying and apologizing like 3 times every 5 minutes. She then went on to say that she doesn‚Äôt even realize she does it most of the time‚Ä¶basically she subconsciously does it.

Court Date soon,10,"Hi, I'm 22 and I'm going to court soon over some charges I took out on my ex boyfriend and I'm feeling really conflicted. When I took out the charges they were just misdemeanors and now that I have talked to the DA and police more they're saying they want to go ahead with harsher charges based on incidents that I didnt report at the time and he's now looking at YEARS instead of months and I feel hesitant about doing all that. I told them i would cooperate in pushing for harsher charges but at the same time I don't know why I'm still worried about him. He really hurt me emotionally, mentally, financially, and physically. But I still think about how he's going to feel, how much he hates jail and how he has never gone to prison, how he's going to miss McDonald's and his daughter (not ours, we don't have kids) and his parents, And its because hes constantly told me its my fault he's in trouble and that I was stupid for telling people, and that he'll go to therapy if thats what I want. He's still deep inside my head as you can see. Maybe its the trauma bonding I don't know. But my stomach turns every time I think about court, or even just a plea deal, because he is going to be in jail for 6-12 months at the least with the charges. I just wanted to hear from someone who understands the attachment or has gone through the courts about domestic violence with stories or advice if thats possible?

Is this domestic violence?,12,"A couple of weeks ago, my husband got really really drunk. I had been drinking but I wasn't super intoxicated. He ended up breaking a bunch of stuff in our room, including a window. I grew up in domestic violence and this type of behavior triggers the shit out of me. So I was walking around and laying with a broom. I don't remember exactly what led to the struggle (it was not me trying to hit him with the broom for sure) but he ended up trying to take the broom from me. There was a struggle and I got hit in the head really hard with the broom handle twice. I'm pretty sure I had a concussion because I was off balance and felt weird for 2 days. The broom hit me when he lost his grip and I was pulling it towards myself and falling down. So he didn't necessarily hit me or push me down. Just struggled with me trying to get the broom. 

There has been one other incident that I would definitely consider domestic violence, but of course his take is ""well, I didn't hit you, its not abuse"". 

Anyway was the broom handle thing domestic violence?",TW Physical Violence
What do I do,1,"So my Mom has been with my asshole stepdad for like 2 years now and they've always argued badly on a weekly basis but two months ago it was the first time he used violence. He choked my Mom and punched her. A week after that happened he did it again, and now last week when I was at my friend's house I think it might've happened again because I saw a big bruise on my mom's leg. I'm also only 13 and a girl so I'm too small to protect my Mom from my stepdad, as he is a big man. I'm too scared to call the police whenever it happens too. I've told my Mom to break up with him but she just says that he promised not to do it again etc. They're also always at the bar and only come home at night just to go back to the bar in the morning.

Happened Once,6,"My husband of 14 years grabbed me by the neck and pushed me up against the wall in the kitchen during an argument. He didn‚Äôt choke me at all and seemed to ‚Äòsnap out of it‚Äô as soon as it happened and put his hands on my shoulders to hold me against the wall because I came back swinging at him.
 
This has NEVER happened before. We rarely even get to the point of real voice raising during an argument.

I shoved him away and say ‚Äòdon‚Äôt you EVER put your hands on me like that.‚Äô and walked out of the room. 
he followed me still arguing and i turned around and said ‚Äòyea? go ahead, put your fucking hands on me again‚Äô and I basically lunged at him out of my own anger that he thought he could dominate me like that.
It was completely surreal and it felt like I was watching it happening to someone else. He almost never yells, he is very non confrontational as a rule. The argument was over him not helping me bring in groceries. He said I should have asked him for help and I said ‚ÄòI should‚Äôve have to ask you for help. You eat these groceries too so you should help carry them inside without having to be told to like a child‚Äô

We finally talked about it the next day when he apologized. Of course I got the ‚Äòyou were saying anything you could to be mean and nasty to me and you wouldn‚Äôt listen‚Äô 
i said ‚Äòbecause i‚Äôd heard enough and youCANNOT put your hands on me -ever, understood?‚Äô
Then somehow the conversation turned into trying to make me feel bad for him because he‚Äôs so stressed right now that he‚Äôs turning into someone he isn‚Äôt.
So like every star of any Lifetime movie, I caved and let it go with a warning.
Later that day I started crying during a shower. He noticed I had been crying and ask what was wrong. I said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ok‚Äô and i‚Äôm not.
I have never been in this situation and i‚Äôve never known anyone in this situation . But as a friend, I would be very concerned about me. Not so much that I think it will happen again but more concerned with experiencing the trauma this clearly inflicted on me and what it‚Äôs done to my psyche, my self esteem and most of all what it‚Äôs done to the trust i had in a man that should never be that angry at me and not be able to control himself.

Is he abusive or reacting to past betrayal?,10,"First post and may be a long and scattered one, please bear with me. I posted in a different forum previously and told him about it and the replies (bad idea I'm sure), he was upset that I didn't include relevant backstory so I will include that in this post. 

I (22F) met my partner (29M) when I was in an abusive relationship with my ex. I began a sexual relationship with my current partner while in a relationship with ex. I didn't think my now partner had feelings for me at the time and believed our relationship was only sexual. Needless to say, he ended up hurt and feeling betrayed over the whole situation. I know now that this hurt him deeply and I feel terrible about that. I was not a good person, I was deeply depressed and was using copious amounts of alcohol to cope with things. After the affair ended, current partner moved away, I stayed with abusive ex. Got pregnant by abusive ex at the same time that the relationship ended. After becoming pregnant I realized I was really messing up my life and others and decided to get my shit together to be a better person.

When my son was about 3 months old I reconnected with current partner who had moved back to our city. We began a relationship. When my son was 6 months old, contact with his father / abusive ex ended after attempted kidnapping. I made clear to current partner I didn't need him to be a replacement dad. We talked about the past and he felt he could get over the past hurt. He did end up becoming a father figure to my son, and is the only dad he knows now at 2.5 years old. 

Fast forward to the present, current partner and I have been together for nearly two years. The relationship was wonderful for the most part. I'd never felt so loved, I finally felt like I could trust and let someone in and that he'd never hurt me. October 2020 we moved in together and in December 2020 we had a baby boy together. After moving in together I noticed a change in current partner, and it became worse after bringing home our baby. 

He constantly tells me he didn't have to accept my older child, and that I should be over the top thankful that he did.  Thinks I'm lying about everything (I admit I'm very non confrontational and have danced around things in an attempt to avoid argument). Has yelled at me and called me horrible names and said awful things to me in front of our kids. Has yelled at both kids but denies it. Doesn't trust me, accuses me of things I didn't do, recently started looking at my phone. Has thrown and broken things in anger. If he's driving and gets angry he speeds and drives recklessly while the kids are in the car. Turns the music up too loud if I'm upset, smacks my hand if I try to turn it down. Uses my past abuse and trauma against me in an argument. Has insinuated he will hit me, told me he hopes I get hurt, drop dead, etc. Has grabbed/pushed me, snapped his fingers in my face while yelling at me. Nothing to hurt or leave a mark but definitely done to intimidate me. Has said 'does 2.5 y/o need a smack' and told me to put 2.5 y/o to bed so he 'doesnt punch him'. If I cry during the yelling he gets more mad, laughs at me, calls me pathetic, always tells me I'm playing the victim,etc. He has a lot of ignorant views, misogyny, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism. He was quite fond of drinking and cocaine when we met, he still does these things on occasion and now smokes marijuana daily.

I know I've called him some mean names and said some shitty things to him during the arguments. I don't yell back. I ask him to leave or to stop yelling in front of the kids. I've told him the behaviour feels abusive and he tells me I'm the one who's abusive and I start questioning myself. He laughs at the fact that if we break up I'll be a single mother of two children by two different men. He tells me a court will question my competence as a mother for dating two abusive men back to back. He's angry that I told him his behaviour is abusive and controlling and demanded an apology which I refused.

I left with my kids just over a month ago after a bad episode and we are staying with my mother. He wants us to move back in but nothing has changed. I see him on weekends with the kids and felt like we could work it out if he was willing to change. We started couples therapy and it's not helped. Therapist says his anger is just a reaction to past hurt and he's taken this as a green light to continue treating me poorly. I brought up the threats and she said it could be taken out of context. He claims she says I seem like a liar and that I play victim. I know I hurt him in the past and I'd take it back if I could. I feel horrible about it still and try very hard now to be a good person, mother and girlfriend. I feel despite the past I still deserve respect from my partner.

Through all of this, the good times are wonderful. He's charming and can be a lovely human and a doting father. My standards feel incredibly low and potential doesn't seem a good enough reason to stay with someone. I don't want to be a single mother but I don't want my sons to grow up thinking this is okay.

If you've read this far, thank you for your time. I apologize if any of the post was confusing. I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Advice? Reassurance that I'm not crazy and that I don't deserve this despite being a shit person in the past? Any comments are much appreciated, thanks in advance",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
"First time posting here, kinda nervous",3,"Just a quick backstory: I recently came out of an abusive relationship back in January after finally being brave enough to actually call police this time that he hurt me. There was a lot of victim blaming from the police and they didn't do much to help me at first. It took nearly 2 months to get a protective order...I moved to a different state temporarily to be with some family just to feel safe. My first visit to the hospital showed that (in addition to all of my external bruising) I had a chest wall injury, rib contusions, and a concussion. Although, due to the swelling, it was difficult to tell at the time if my ribs were fractured. I suffered some kind of knee injury as well but it wasn't checked out at the time because there was still so much adrenaline from the incident that I had not even noticed the swelling on my knee yet.

Fast forward to now: I still get severe pain in my ribs and my knee if I move the wrong way or if I accidently overwork myself some days. I absolutely hate it....not just because it hurts and it's uncomfortable....but also because it's a constant reminder of what happened. I could be having a great day, but accidentally stretch the wrong way, and that sharp pain sends me into another spiral. I'm worried I actually had fractures on my ribs that were missed in my initial x-rays, but I haven't been able to return for more imaging because I can't really afford more medical bills right now. I figured that maybe they would take a little longer to heal than normal because I had to do alot of moving and heavy lifting when I packed up and relocated, but we're now halfway through May and they still hurt quite a bit. 

I beat myself up alot for it. Although I know my body will heal eventually, I often get thoughts like maybe my body will never be the same after what he did to me.... 

Would anyone happen to have any suggestions in regards to: 
- Possible resources for getting another checkup soon
- Advice on trying to get all of it from playing on repeat in my head all the time. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again. 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.",TW Physical Violence
What else could he possible want?,2,"I left my abusive relationship over a year ago. Although we weren't together, things escalated and he assaulted me in February when he found out I was dating.

There is a restraining order and he is currently awaiting trial. 

I recently saw him driving past my house where I live , I moved to a completely different city about an hour away from him and 30 minutes away from where I use to live. There is no reason for him to be in my city let alone my neighborhood and I do not think that this was a coincidence. I feel like he was looking for me. Why won't he just let me be?

I really was looking for help so I'm going to try again here in the hopes that someone can offer advice or even kind words... 

I (27F) have been dating let's call him John (32M) since about October 2020. But about 6 or so years ago is when we actually met and when we first dated. That time lasted a couple months. Maybe 2 or 3. Then we broke up and from 2016-2020 I dated, let's call him Seth (27M) until we broke up. John started texting me about hanging out summer 2020 and we eventually did. There is a LOT to this story so I'm going to leave out lots of it and stick to the most recent parts and only relevant parts from the past. So John is non committal and emotionally unavailable. I told him I just wanted to be friends now since we have been dating for months and he still won't call me his girlfriend. He's also always getting mad at me for little things and has severe anger issues. He was a marine in Iraq. He basically told me fine he didn't care, why would he want me anyways. It broke my heart but I thought whatever I genuinely enjoy his company and maybe one day we could be friends.

He knew I initially said it'd be hard to be friends because it would hurt me too much so when I hung out with him Friday he wanted to know what changed. So I told him the truth. That I joined online dating and it had given me hope that I could really find someone who would want me and commit to me. He. Lost. His shit. I was at his house, drinking and could not drive until I had relaxed for another hour or 2. He took the large heater he had in front of him and threw it. He screamed at me and called me every name in the book. Basically the night went as follows... I don't remember much because it was traumatizing and I was genuinely afraid. I was in the bathroom peeing and he came in and dumped a bottle of water on me. Later I was crying and he had hid the alcohol from me in the bathroom, I went in there to grab it for a drink and he chased me in there and grabbed the bottle. When I turned around to face him he grabbed my neck with his hand and forcibly moved me out of the bathroom. I tried to hide in his bedroom but he came in and demanded I go back in the living room. Sobbing I said no and he threatened to make me. I kept saying no so he grabbed my ankle and dragged me into the living room then dropped me off in front of the couch. He then grabbed my face, pinching my cheeks and moved my head so I was facing the marine flag on his wall and said ""do you know what the f*ck that means? Do you know who the f*ck I am?!"". He stole my purse to hide in his cars trunk and when I tried to stop him at the door he pushed me into the wall and slammed the front door into me. Then he came back in and said he's taking me home and I can get my car the next day. I cried and said no I have a family thing tomorrow I need my car please let me drive home. And he said no I can't drive. And I tried pleading saying I would sit there silently for 30 minutes then until he felt I was ok to drive and then I'd go home and we'd never have to see each other again. The whole time he's telling me if I don't get the F up he's going to grab my hair and drag me to the car. I have long hair and it was in a ponytail. I kept begging him not to but finally he did and dragged me to the door. He stopped and ran to the bathroom. I hoped maybe he knew he went too far and maybe felt guilty or something. But he came back out and stared at me so I opened the door and walked to his car while silently sobbing. He called me a bitch in the car. He drove me home but drove right past my house. I kept asking where he was taking me but he just kept driving for half an hour with music blasting not saying a word until we got back to his house. I got out and he handed me my purse and I grabbed it and ran to my car and drove home. He later said he was being nice by taking my ""sorry ass"" back to my car cuz he didn't have money to give me for an Uber. But he also later texted me saying he should have wrapped his car around a tree that night and ""done the world a favor"". Idk if he was talking about killing me or him or both. 

Also relevant is that I owe him around $200. We were dating for a bit and he never had a problem lending me money and NEVER hounded me for it. The next day, Saturday, he started texting me that he wants his money and then for me to get out of his life. I said okay I'll leave it in between his front door and screen door on payday. He gets livid. Says NO, that I HAVE to come inside and physically hand it to him. I ask why and he says cuz I said so bitch. I tell him I'm not going to do that and then he starts threatening me. Saying things like:
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. 
Do it bitch or I'll drag you around again like I did last night. Like a piece of garbage. 
See what happens
You'll suffer the consequences
You'll regret it

Then when that didn't work and I was not scared and said his threats are empty cuz I hate my life anyways go ahead and kill me, he said ""hahaha are they c*nt?? Woof woof. There's things you care about more than you. I'll make you watch them suffer"" referring to my dog (and probably my best friends kids because he knows they are my life) and starts saying he's gonna wait til I leave my house and all this stuff. I am genuinely afraid. I KNOW he means it. I KNOW he will hurt me and idk about my friends kids but I KNOW he will hurt my dog to hurt me.

That ex, Seth, I dated for 4 years hit me when we were dating. I called the police. The police arrested me for obstruction when I was afraid to press charges. So I don't like dealing with the cops and he knows this story and knows that I have video evidence of my ex abusing me but I never pressed charges. So I'm sure he knows.. or thinks that I would never go to the cops. But at most the very most that could happen is probably probation and he'd maybe lose his job and if that happened I know he wouldn't stop til he got revenge. I think I should just go drop the money off and have someone waiting outside for me. Or be on the phone with my friend during it. He says he never wants to see me again and he hates my guts blah blah. So after he gets his stupid money I can't imagine he'd still bother me?? 

Also I genuinely was in love with this guy. I was blinded by love and ignored every red flag. The things he's saying, hating me, wishing I was dead, telling me to KMS and record it so he can watch it because ""seeing it once won't be enough"". I am so fucking destroyed. I literally hate myself. I hate my life. I'm depressed. I can't stop crying. I don't know how to move past this mentally and emotionally. I loved a man who pretended to care about me and I really don't know wtf his end game was with me but he never loved me back clearly. I'm broken.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
I walked away. I‚Äôm still so heart broken.,10,"I was dating a (25 now 26 M) for a bit over a year. He disclosed to me he had anger problems and would have outbursts. I didn‚Äôt think much about it until we fought. He first would punch walls, or throw things. Screaming and slamming doors. Then it turned into me getting pushed, thrown, shoved. It was awful. But he was so remorseful I felt things would get better. We would go through long periods of being okay. Even if we did fight we had normal fights. I recently was thrown and smacked. I had to leave. I couldn‚Äôt be with this person anymore. 

I‚Äôm now a month into not being with him anymore. We‚Äôve met a couple times and have chatted a couple times. He continues to apologize and accept he did something horrible. His family knows. He is currently getting help and I hope one day things work out for him.

Does this count as domestic violence,7,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I was reminded a while back about an incident from when I was in middle school and wanted to know if it counts as domestic violence.

I was about 12 and my brother was maybe 15. We were sitting on the couch and I was being a brat and saying really mean things about his friends. He got really mad and grabbed my thigh really hard. I ran and locked myself in a bathroom and squatted in front of the sink. He was right behind me and kicked the bathroom door open. He then kicked the cabinet door right next to me and it fell off the hinges. He yelled at me for a bit but I no longer remember the contents. He then stormed out of the house. My thigh ended up with a hand shaped bruise for a few days. 

I never told my mom. When she had asked about the bathroom cabinet I just told her my brother had another ""black out"" which is what he called his fits of anger and she was like ""oh okay"".

It's now like a decade later. I had forgotten about this incident until I was talking to my brother's girlfriend and she mentioned some of my brother's life regrets. She said he considers what he did that day to be one of his biggest regrets. 

When I told my boyfriend about this he said ""Yeah it all makes sense now. You always say how you don't like it when your brother tries to hug you goodbye and stuff. You were abused.""

Does it count as abuse? I always considered abuse a chronic long term type of trauma. This was a one time occurrence. I had completely forgotten it even happened. Plus it seemed to have weighed on my brother.

We've been together for four years and he was always abusive and controling me. I failed a lot of times to leave, always forgave him and believed him telling me it is the last time. 

We got married in 2019. I was 19, and he 22. I did not really want it, but kind of had to. I wanted to apply to university in another country. Of course he wouldn't let me go without him. On the other hand, my parents wouldn't let us go abroad or live together without being married, because of their cultural and religious beliefs.

We were accepted at the university both in the same class. Though I didnt want him to apply to the same course as me. He already has a bachelor degree in a related field. It was yet another way for him to be close to me, so he could control me.

In the last year he started to hit me. Once I told our parents and they were shocked, but neither his or mine supported me to divorce.

Fast forward to 2021, he abuses me constantly. Plays video games all day and night, disturbing my sleep. I am the only one having a job, I do all the house chores. If I don't have time to cook, we would stay hungry all day, and yet he blames me. We have problems at university. We owe a lot of money to a friend for his new PC.

He threatens me to kill himself with the knife when I start to talk about things that bother me. In the last 3 months he physically abuses me almost every 3-10 days. 

All this time I hoped he could get better. But we all know they dont.

I really hope thst I am finally strong enough to break this abusive cycle. For the first time I feel better without him, and I am not crying constantly thinking about all the good moments with him.

I am safe with my parents. they support me, I told them everything. But still they feel sorry for him and tell me not to hurry with the divorce. His parents laugh at me, telling me every family has issues, and that I am behaving like a child, blaming me for not giving him one more chance.

All I want now is to get him out of my life, but I dont really have all the support I need. My parents wont let me file the divorce so soon. I am afraid I will forgive him again. 

He isnt agressive now and keeps calling my parents to make them feel sorry for him, and they fall for it. He is absolutely against divorce, and most probably I will need a restraining order.

 I am afraid I am not that strong to keep myself on the right path. I still have all my clothes and stuff (including things I will get expelled out of university without) at our rent abroad, where he is now.  I am responsible for the rent contract, because he never cared for anything. So I will be the one the landlord has to blame for staying only two months, when I promised we will stay at least one year.

What do I do next? How do I take my stuff back and terminate the rent, with him not wanting to move to his parents? How do I find strength to keep fighting for myself? If I will go back I will forgive him, but the abuse will get worse.",TW Physical Violence
Why can‚Äôt I leave him?,3,"This may be a long post. 

I‚Äôve been married for over a year now and we have a 12 month old and I‚Äôm due to have a baby in 4 weeks. I also have a 4 year old from a previous relationship. We have been together for 3 years in August so everything has happened very fast. 

Some background:
At first he was very charming, gave me expensive gifts and took me overseas on a holiday. He made me feel special, wanted, heard. He wasn‚Äôt my ideal partner though. He can be shallow, boastful, materialistic and cares far too much about other peoples approval, being the best etc. I chose to oversee those traits because I though he‚Äôs still young and can grow out of those ‚Äúchildish‚Äù traits.

He has changed, he is not the person he was. I noticed this change happening just before our wedding. He would always say leaving each other isn‚Äôt an option, we work it out we are a team. Now any time I bring up an issue no matter how small I am met with ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it f*cking leave me, you know who I am‚Äù. I get that most days now. He will never take accountability for his actions, how he hurts me with his verbal abuse. He has been physical with me on a few occasions while pregnant. Thrown me to the ground, thrown me on the bed, stepped on my head. I would be a crying mess afterwards and he would show no remorse, say I‚Äôve don‚Äôt it to myself. I get scared when he drinks too much, he gets violent. Last night coming home from a friends wedding he was boasting about himself for a solid hour and I asked if we could talk about something else. I was told ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like how I am leave me‚Äù. I explained calmly I was so tired of hearing that and I think maybe he should get counselling. He completely disagreed and said he would just leave me. I agreed with him and he started punching the car door. He busted his hand up badly. 

Other worrying traits are;
-He doesn‚Äôt approve of how I dress sometimes. He never tells me to change but he makes me feel so uncomfortable I‚Äôve thrown away all my shorter dresses. If I show any cleavage he gets annoyed.
-He pays for my car and phone and reminds me he can take them away and does so when we fight. If I try to drive away with the kids mid fight he takes the keys or comes with me just to‚Äùannoy me‚Äù.
-He jokes about how I‚Äôm scared of him and how he‚Äôs so much stronger than me
-He jokes if I ever leave I‚Äôll run right back
-I spend all of my money on the kids and food with nothing left for myself. When I run out of money he gets annoyed and asks what I‚Äôve spent my money on. I‚Äôve had to show him bank statements before. He makes me feel very uncomfortable asking for money for things the kids NEED. Because I should manage my money better? While he spends a lot of money on alcohol. 

My midwife is aware there has been physical abuse and I‚Äôve been assigned a social worker.

I‚Äôm stuck. My first born hates him, my parents don‚Äôt like him. I resent him when he‚Äôs horrid but I do truely love him. I‚Äôm holding onto hope he can get some help and we can move forward.
I guess I‚Äôm just venting and looking for some advice. I was raised thinking domestic violence was normal. I don‚Äôt want this for my children. So I keep my mouth shut most of the time now and take the path of least resistance.",TW Physical Violence

What if I see him again?,1,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL VIOLENCE, ASSAULT, PROTECTION ORDER


I am safe. I am safe. I am safe.  
I live in Seattle. I was granted a domestic violence protection order in January ! Our city and state are trying to open things up now and I'm excited and vaccinated ! but still plan to isolate for a while more. I'm hopeful. And I'm terrified because what do I do if I see him again? Can I tell him to get 500 feet back from me or am I breaking my own order then? Do I automatically have staying power anywhere I am and he has to leave? What if we both bought tickets to a venue? What if he stalks my favorite artists and finds me that way? What if I have my dog (who is larger than me and still has puppy forgetfuls even w great training)and gets excited to see him?  What if I can't play rugby?
I guess I'd also like to take this time to tell me some of my story. 


I chose to go to university near my parents in MO bc I was learning to love w bipolar and cptsd and need a lot of support. I met VLB, one of my residents became a coworker then a fling then a relationship then we lived together a year. Had a lot of toxic patterns established but broke up bcuz VLB moved to Chicago after grad 2015. Stayed in touch. I change my name and announce I'm poly amorous and pansexual in 2017. 2019 I start making plans to move to Seattle bc MO is not a good environment for me. A mutual friend, RL lives in Seattle so we start looking for places. VLB says he's miserable and Chicago and wants to join us. He knows that we are only friends. My bff joins in on my plans even tho I tell her it's a bad idea. She says our love is strong enough and I believe her. In retrospect I see all of my weak and non exist boundaries and I was in a low key episode leading up to moving in June 2019. All four of us are in a 3 bedroom in south Seattle. Bff and I are sharing a LARGE room w a bathroom. By sept, her and I are on the outs and can't communicate effectively. I get really sick from stress and become basically bulimic for a couple months. In October I tried to physically remove her from the house after she started screaming at me. Technically assault and very short sighting, but I wasn't intent on hurting her I just wanted to lock her out. It's still harmful and toxic behavior. VLB split us up and offer to switch rooms with BFF so she could stay and I said no but they said yes. I couldn't leave at this point bc I was barely making enough money and didn't know anyone else in the city, I was signed into a lease and the reason they were all under the same house together. Oh and my car went kaput so he let me use his car. VLB would treat me to dinner or a night out but then hold it over me. He would wait until we were both drunk then try to make sexual advances at me. In vulnerable times, I would cave even though I knew it'd be messy. And then he started professing his love for me and kept saying we were open partners. In November 2019, idk anything else besides we were all drinking and then I woke up convulsing to VBL pulling RL off me. In Jan 2020 we'd ""broken up"" so many times. I was usually always a closing bartender he'd wait up drunk for me to get home only to scream at me for whatever. He get pillows until he moved on to walls. If I was late he'd track me through my laptop. BFF and RL said I needed medication and help. I said VLB needed help. He said he'd go to therapy but would never follow through even w all of his resources. Bff moved out at the end of Jan 2020 and I got my own room. I could always hear VLB and RL talk shit about me. RL would scoff or groin anytime I was in the same room as him then call my dog to him. He'd purposely scare my dog but making loud sounds, etc. He drew red eyes and devil horns on my pictures. VLB would still stalk me and sometimes show up to my bar w my dog. One time, after screaming at each other late and night and finally getting him out of my room he lunged at my as I was shutting the door and I hit him to get him out of my door way and closed the door. Then the next morning RL woke me up to tell me that I had toxic behavior and needed help. By the time covid shortened my hours I knew I needed to leave on way or another. I found a craiglist may 2020 women's house in north Seattle and some coworkers helped me move. VBL agreed to cut all connect to allow healing but would still text or message or Instagram me and then the coworker that helped me move. I would ignore or tell him to stop. I changed my number in Sept 2020 and warned VBL to stop or I would escalate.

I started my domestic violence protection order request in Nov 2020 but he got a lawyer and they kept trying to get more time for me to drop it. Thankfully it was granted against VBL. I never sought one against RL bc he only harassed me in the house to side w VBL. Now I'm in a studio in Seattle ! And I'm finally gaining weight ! All my accounts are on private. I don't go out besides work and walks but that's going to change at some point. And the thing I'm most excited for is rugby. I miss playing and being on a team and I'd love my dog to be a mascot of something in this life bc he's so cute. But RL has been playing rugby for a Seattle team since before I moved. What if I run into him? What if they're both there? Only VBL is required to go. I guess I could check derby out but it's not outdoors.    

Anyone wanna scenario play or direct me to better resources? 

Thank you kindly and stay safe",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Feeling fed up and maybe wanting out of the relationship,4,"I posted on here about a month ago about my problems. I guess this is an update and me needing validation/support (little bit of both) last time I posted on here I talked about the physical and emotional abuse. Well he did it again. Literally a week after my last post, he tried to choke me because I refused to help him change our sons dirty diaper (he went #2). And then I think it was 2 days before I was induced we got into an argument about how he felt like it was my fault he wasnt working out and was upset all the time, and of course me being me I got super upset and told him it wasnt fair for him to be blaming me and I kept telling him that and he would just say ok ok leave me alone, but of course I felt dismissed so I got upset and he ended up punched me in the face several times because I wouldnt leave him alone... and then he tried to push in my eyes. I think  I'm so angry at myself for not saying anything because now he's on deployment and he's being emotionally abusive. He says he hates me he says f* you he calls me the b word.. its horrible . And let me tell you guys this is all 3 weeks postpartum after he was with me for our daughters birth and the doctors told us I essentially could've died from the emergency c-section because of how much blood I lost (I'm still dealing with that trauma) sorry for this horrible update I know it must bother some.
But all this to say I'm finally getting fed up. I'm slowly starting to see how emotionally he isnt there for me and doesnt even try to be. I dont feel loved or appreciated and I really feel like he doesnt respect me. I feel like part of me stays one because I'm terrified of not getting full custody of the kids (I dont want him in our lives at all), two because I feel like if we do split up he'll paint me to be the bad guy or the one who didnt try and I dont know why but I care a lot if he goes around saying I was the problem in the marriage. But I'm slowly wanting to let him go.

Ironically I'm meeting up with friends (they both work from home so please dont criticize me about covid) tomorrow. Do you guys think I should tell them what's going on? Should I ask them to help me be able to divorce my husband (more of the emotional and hand holding support)
Do you guys have any advice or experience with how custody ends up going? Any advice on how I can stop caring what he'll say to others if we divorce?",TW Physical Violence
My Story,9,"I'm writing this hoping it will help with someone to keep moving forward and maybe give them hope that it does get better. I will try to make this kind of short so I apologize for the length in advance. 

On November 22, 2017 my bf of 6 months who was living with me in the separate apartment of my parents home in Germany tried to kill me and he was pretty close to doing so.  Before that day he never even raised his voice at me, let alone put his hands on me. We got along together and didn't really argue much because I'm a pretty chill and quiet person. 

He was in the Army so I thought he was a good guy but after the incident I definitely remembered some red flags that I decided to ignore because he said he loved me and saw a future with me such as getting married and having kids. I remember in some of our really intense arguments he would manipulate me making me believe that I hurt him and he looked like a dummy for even staying with me but he stayed because he loved me. I also remember him seeming to hold back in our arguments and just saying okay in the end just so we would stop arguing. And even if he was in the Army he started to smoke weed with me saying he had it under control. I didn't really agree with it because I feel like if you make that promise and join the military then you should truly commit but I thought he's an adult it's his choice. 

He basically put on this mask making everyone believe he was a great guy and he loved me. My parents did have a slight feeling something was off with him but they ignored it because they saw how much he would make me laugh and how much fun we would have together. They asked me if I wanted him there in our home and if I felt comfortable, I said yes but of course he fooled us all. 

On the day he snapped he was coming back from a two week mission in Grafenwoehr and I walked into the house upset at him because I wasn't sure if he was even coming back home and he was ignoring my calls and texts all day so I said I was leaving and didn't even want to look at him. I got into my car and he also got in trying to stop me until he said fine just go and that's when he tried to go back into the house I noticed he locked himself out so I decided let me talk to him at least. The last thing I remember is opening the door and him saying ""yeah please come talk to me"" 

I have no memory of the actual incident but I see the proof of it everyday I look in the mirror. I suffered a brain injury and had to learn how to walk again. He bashed in the right side of my face and nose with only his fist and he also strangled me. I've had probably over 10 surgeries to reconstruct my face, I'm not even sure anymore I lost count at 7 maybe its over 15 now. The right side of my face doesn't really move anymore, my last surgery will probably be to help me be able to smile again. I have metal plates in my face to replace all of the bone he fractured and broke. My right eye also doesn't entirely work right anymore, I sometimes have double vision and it makes me dizzy sometimes. I just had my last nose surgery on April 29th so I'm still in recovery now. And the absolute sickest thing he did was pull out my nipple piercings so I hope in the future I can find someone to reconstruct them. 

He is obviously in prison now since 2018 and he was sentenced 25 years because he took a plea deal which I don't think it's enough and he wasn't even charged with attempted murder but it is what it is. I actually went to the trial sitting there the whole time with an eye patch because of my double vision and I even testified against him as he sat there looking at me with disgust. Even though I think he should have gotten life I'm glad I testified to help him get sentenced to the fullest extent possible. 

Even after more than three years have passed I can't say I'm fully healed mentally, emotionally, or even physically but I'm definitely better than I was in the start. I can walk just fine now after teaching myself and improving my strength in the gym. I will definitely need lots and lots of therapy to help accepting the way I look now, my social anxiety, and ptsd towards men once I have the chance to get it. It's honestly hard for me to accept I'm a survivor of domestic violence because I feel like I never truly experienced it since I have no memory of the one time I went through it. 

I'm still currently living with my parents as they help me get through this but I'm happy to say soon I'm moving back to Germany and to be with my absolutely amazing and loving bf who I met here on reddit. I can honestly say he accepts and loves me for who I am both on the inside and outside and everyday he helps me learn how to love myself and just overall feel better about myself. I still have so much ahead of me to learn and overcome but I know I can do it. So if I can do this, I know you can do whatever you put your mind to. This is taking a lot for me to write so I truly hope this helps you. 

I've been thinking whether I should make videos about talking more in depth about my experience but I kind of think it would be stupid so let me know what you think and if you have any questions about anything please feel free to ask. Please know that all of you on here going through anything horrible, you're worthy and you're wonderful, please don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise and I love you",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

Hi all,13,"I finally made a move against my abuser today and I feel completely broken, although I know it was the right move. For years, he has been mentally and emotionally abusive.

He has hit me so hard WHILE I was holding our 1 year old, my eyes ring and I felt dizzy.

Next step,2,"Today I talked to the assistant district attorney about my case. He has been charged with domestic assault and unlawful photography even though he tried to strangle me. The ADA is hoping to use that in against him. She wants him to plead guilty to both charges and do consecutive probation which would equal two years. In the state of Tennessee, if you are convicted of a misdemeanor domestic assault charge, you lose all your gun rights. He knows this because he is a gun lover. I‚Äôm worried he will want to take the case to the grand jury. The ADA told me that if he wants to take it to the grand jury, then the likelihood of him getting charged with aggravated domestic assault goes up. That is a felony. I‚Äôm hoping he accepts the plea bargain knowing that he can be charged with a felony if he chooses to continue. Then he could possibly face jail time and still lose his gun rights. The court advocate is going to request a batters course, a substance abuse assessment, and a mental health assessment. I knew he would not face any jail time on two misdemeanor charges. The ADA feels confident he will plead guilty. My gut isn‚Äôt telling me anything. He can‚Äôt afford to take this all the way to court so I hope that also works in my favor. He will never be the police officer he dreamed he would be and his military career is probably over. The ADA is going to prepare the offer and submit it to his lawyer next month.

Am I wrong for thinking this is abuse?,6,"I have a roommate, we'll call them ""D""

D is my friend but also my in-home caretaker. I am disabled and have difficulties in a few areas of my life so I have D listed as my caretaker because he helps with mobility, hygiene, remembering things, etc.. D is a friend I value very much.

Anyway, D has rage issues toward me in person. Part of it is neurodivergence, and I get that. Yet, at some point, abuse is abuse, right? Whenever he doesn't understand some point I make about certain subjects he tends to fly into a very loud rage and yells at me and tries to make me feel like I am an inhuman piece of shit. Most recently, he said that when I tweeted that I, a historian of sexuality, would rather have public sex than undoing health insurance, I was actually advocating for rape. He then said that the few times we fooled around physically I pressured him and that I was no better than a rapist.

First off, in every single case of any physical relation, it was D that initiated it. Every single time. How do I know this? It's because I have crippling anxiety about sex and approaching people for it. I can think of very few instances where I came on to people in order to ask for relations but many more where they did things like grabbed my hand, pushed me around, climbed on me, offered to pleasure me (something he did a couple of days ago when I said my accident has made it near-impossible to have sex), and so on. Internally I just had to deal with his conduct because for a lot of reasons it felt like I was alone and not sharing intimacy with a friend I valued deeply was basically rejecting their friendship. His comment just shook me and now I am not sure that I'm not a rapist when, again, I've been the one pressured time and again.

Second, I am a scholar of sexuality and I know well enough what is and isn't rape advocacy, and I also know what's up with how community forms with folks that hookup anonymously. It's literally all I study, it's absurd how much I know about this in a Western American context. I do not understand how anyone can correlate what I said with advocating for rape, especially when in the twitter thread I repeatedly reference consent.

So as he's yelling at me and calling me names and stuff I kept asking D to calm down and not yell at me. I said that if he thought that I was advocating for rape, I apologize, and I clarified yet he still kept yelling and being mad. He went in on me further and when he said I had repeatedly coerced him into sex it was just all over for me and I apologized for that as well immediately. Now, I've been assaulted numerous times, mind you, so the impact of what he said was very sharp and painful. It made me question what I've been and who I've been. I still am hours later.

I've never been yelled at so much in my life and I come from an abusive family. I also understand that D's neurodivergence causes a lot of misunderstandings which might cause him to react initially with hurt, upset, or rage. I don't want to be considered an abuser myself for not understanding why he's yelling at me and I've always politely asked him to ""please"" not yell at me.

I don't know what to do. I need the help around the house but if this is abuse I don't want to be deluded anymore. At the same time, I want to be understanding of his disability and difficulties. I also don't want to assume that angry, hurt yelling and physically squaring up while yelling at me is indicative of potential violence. I'm actually upset that I even think he's being abusive and I'm trying desperately to talk about this situation but it's so hard and I don't even know if I'm a good person anymore.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
My ex bf is going to jail,5,"He pushes me and grabs me, always causing little bruises. I know it's wrong but he gets in my head and says he barely ""touched me"".

I started crying and yelling for him to leave and he got even more mad and grabbed my neck, then tried to take my phone (so I wouldn't call the police because I was threatening to if he wouldn't leave), he hurt my wrist grabbing me so I dialed 911 because I live in an apartment and I didn't need my neighbors to hear and just wanted him to leave. He grabbed me, cornered me and forced the phone from my hand and hung up 911 and took off running down the hallway with my phone towards the elevator. Luckily a neighbor saw and he gave the phone back because of it. As soon as I got it back I called 911 and told them everything. Now he's going to jail for a minimum of a couple months because he had a warrant and was out on probation. I feel really bad and guilty for sending him to jail.

My ex called and said He was done with ME...why am I sad?,2," 

I left my ex at the end of January, and when I mean I left... I left. I live in the midwest so winters can be hard. I packed up my things one night while my abuser slept. Then I got my dog and we took off. It took us an hour and a half to get home, a drive that usually takes 30 minutes tops.

I was so scared. He was hurting me pretty badly. It started small. Him grabbing my arm when he was mad at me, grabbing my face if I wouldnt look at him when I was sad. Then it escalated. One day he dislocated my shoulder bad enough I had to go to the doctor and get strong pain meds. A month before we broke up he pinned me on the bed one night and choked me until I started to see black. The night before I left to my moms house he elbowed me in the face and I locked myself in the bathroom and slept in there. After every encounter of violence he would tell me how sorry he was and how he was a ""monster"" and how no one would ever like him and how he was a bad person and how he was never loved.

The first month was the worst... I felt massive amounts of regret because of course he would call and text me saying how sorry he was and how hed never hurt me again. Hed tell me he loved me. Something I longed for him to say so many times when we were together. My friends and family were very supportive and made it very clear I was not to go back (something I was not happy about at the time but am now). I slowly got better and made progress.

Please do not ask me why I didnt block him..it is so hard. I took him off everything but my phone. This weekend he called me non-stop. I told him I did not want to talk to him. There was nothing left for us to talk about. He got so mad and threatened to come after me to my moms house where I was. Yesterday he called me. I answered..I know it wasnt a good idea... he started yelling at me. Telling me I was the reason for all the drama in his life, and that he was done with me. Then he threatened to call people and tell them I was going to kill myself (something I personally would not do and was not in a spot where it would even cross my mind) and get me institutionalized.

Since this last encounter, I have taken him off my phone but it still hurts so bad. I have been so depressed. I didnt get out of bed until 3 PM today. I moved to my couch and laid back down. I am so sad. How come I can still have love in my heart for this ""man"" who treated me so badly and hurt me mentally and physically. How can I be so sad by the thought of never speaking to him again. I did so much for him because I loved him. All I wanted was to be loved back.",TW Physical Violence

I don't want to deprive her of her father, or him of his kids, so how do I keep myself safe while also allowing shared custody?",Preparing To Leave
Can it be a one off?,11,"Pretty much what the title says, I guess. Can people slip up, and have it never happen again?  
  
The shortened version is, my partner(28m) and I(28f) had a huge blow up fight. We often have fights, but this one was bad. Communication is not good at times, as we both have different mental illnesses that clash - but both are working on things and genuinely want it to work. We are very serious, been together for about 1.5yrs and had planned on forever. We always strive to better ourselves, our actions, and our relationship. 90% of the time, he‚Äôs truly amazing and we look after each other well. But..   
  
A few days ago, during this fight, he tried to break in a door I‚Äôd locked. I‚Äôve locked the door before in fights and he knows if he knocks, I‚Äôll let him in. But he saw red and tried to break it down instead. We were both being arseholes in this fight, there‚Äôs no denying that. But we have both been in physically abusive relationships before.. And he knows how terrified violence makes me. I cannot handle it at all.    
  
He has been mildly emotionally abusive before but has taken a lot of steps to fix that behaviour and no longer acts that way. He didn‚Äôt understand his actions were abusive in those instances, but has taken on board what I‚Äôve said and changed his ways regardless. Almost every time we have an issue, and it‚Äôs his doing, he will change. There‚Äôs been times when it‚Äôs been done with dragged heels per say, but he comes around once he‚Äôs had a while to think about things.   
  
With this violence incident, he is extremely sorry. He is sorting out the door and he‚Äôs been extremely apologetic, understanding and letting me make all the calls. We have continued communications and decided on some plans which I don‚Äôt doubt he will stick to. For now, I am still struggling to be around him and while he‚Äôs in a very fragile state, he‚Äôs still being very understanding.   
  
Is there hope? He‚Äôs shown the ability to change in the past, and always followed through, so I think there might be. But it‚Äôs all so scary and confusing, and I‚Äôm in such a triggered state still even days later, that I don‚Äôt know what to think.",TW Physical Violence
"Guilt for helping Mother, even though its the right thing",3,"My mother is with my father nearly 30 years. I'm in my 30s (f) and married, I don't live with them. Moved out when I was a teenager and I have a strained relationship with my father, he's always been the controlling type, gaslighting, narcissistic etc.

My mother, on too many occasions to count, cried telling me how she's being treated, how miserable she is, how she feels worthless. 

He used to get violent when we were younger but since we're all grown up he doesn't do that now. He financially controls her, he spends all the money (gambling) and tells her she spends its all because she's given $15 a week for herself. He has all the money and bills often go unpaid (she gives all her money to him to keep him quiet, even though it doesn't work) He screams and shouts at her for every minor thing, smokes cannabis and sleeps in all day, doesn't let her go into town, or want her to work (they live in the countryside and he is the only one with a car, she isn't allowed her own because ""they can't afford it""), tells her she's ruined everyone's life's (how?)

That isn't putting a dent in it. My mother is 53, and I can't believe her life is like this.

My younger sister who lives at home with them feels like I'm ""dragging our mother away"". My sister has her own issues (a baby and just out of an abusive relationship) and depends on my mother alot. 

I get where she's coming from being saddened by my mother leaving, but I'm not dragging her away, she told me she needs to leave, and made arrangements herself, I just helped her with a friendly ear, and some computer related stuff (applications, emails) 

My father is also acting like I'm going behind his back but he was already told my mother is leaving? 
He also told me a few months ago that he doesn't want to be with her and if she doesn't go eventually he will (which would leave her isolated in the countryside with no car) 

I live my family but this is having a toll on my mental health, I feel like the finger is being pointed at me already and I'll be blamed for everything. I have alot in my own life I need to sort out and because of this I put up 20 pounds in 3 months and am anxious and depressed. 

Please tell me if I'm dealing with all of this correctly, I feel like I am but I need some kind of reassurance that I'm not the villian I'm seen as.

Should I just let my abusive ex get away with it??,5,"Long story short, my ex bf was gonna go to jail for physically assaulting me. (He had previous assault and battery charges from years ago which made this incident worse) They enforced a no contact order but unfortunately I ended up contacting him after the incident, bc I felt bad for calling the cops on him and missed him. He convinced me if I gave him another chance that everything would be perfect and blah blah. 

So anyway, our relationship was great for a few months and on the court date, I COMPLETELY downplayed the incident, I didn‚Äôt lie, I just left out info that would hurt him (like how he gave me a concussion, photos of the bruises) and wrote an impact statement about how great of a person he is etc etc... basically saved his ass from getting in serious trouble. 

Well the court told him if he violates probation he will go straight to jail. The no contact was part of his probation but he still wanted to continue dating. Not long after his sentencing, the abuse started back up. Nothing physical this time, but emotional, verbal, and sexual. I would break up with him and tell him if he doesn‚Äôt leave me alone I would report him. He would find other ways to contact me even while he was blocked. 

Some times I gave in bc he would send me gifts and apologies and be so sweet. These breakups/makeups were a non stop cycle. I still get harassing messages (direct and indirect) from him and now I truly want to report him not only bc of the continued harassment, but bc of the resentment I feel toward all the shit he has done to me in the past. And pretending to ""love"" me so I would keep him out of jail. 

Many people have told me I shouldn‚Äôt do this bc I was the one who kept going back to him while knowing how shitty he was. I‚Äôve been told to just let it go, move on, learn from my mistakes, he will leave me alone eventually, etc. ANDDD that if I do tell on him, I will just get bad karma. 

Does anyone else see it from this point of view? Bottom line is, he abused me in every way possible. And yes, I kept going back to him when I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have. So What is the ‚Äúmorally correct‚Äù thing to do??

Part of me is afraid I'll get bad karma. But I also don't want to look back in the future and hate myself for letting someone ruin me this badly, and letting them get away with it.",TW Physical Violence
Should I go no contact with my abusive parents?,7," 

My childhood hadn't been too bad, which I'm grateful for. My family went on vacation once a year, had food on the table and I go to a good school. My dad's favorite form of punishment was always physical, whether it was slapping me in the face, spanking, hitting me with metal spoons, kicking me, ect but thankfully this only happened once every other month. When I got older, I thankfully learned what set him off (getting yelled at at work, whenever he lost his job ... which happened quite a lot, getting yelled at by my mom or when his sports team would lose) and learned to avoid him during these times or just patiently agree with him on whatever.

Even with this, he still managed to be the lesser of two evils, especially recently. My mom's always turned a blind eye to his abuse, which pisses me off since she's a teacher, unless she was encouraging it with vague "" just wait until your dad hears what you did"" threats. My mom's always been bitter towards him that he didn't make enough money for her to become a stay at home mom, and feels she missed out on a lot of my childhood. To compensate she tries to be super on top of me right now and for the past year (I guess covid made it a lot worse?) and won't let me have sleepovers with my friends, flipped out and shamed me when she snooped through my room and had sex toys, tries to take away my phone/ laptop when I don't talk to her as much as she would like (give her one sentance answers, don't initiate conversations), flipped out when I put a lock on my bedroom door after I started snooping, and when a fight with my dad and I got physical, she spun it into me being homicidal even though most people agree it was self defense (I didn't hurt him/ kill him, but took a pocket knife out of my pocket to protect myself), and sent me to a psych hospital.

While I was there, my mom told highly exaggerated versions of the story to everyone and painted herself as a selfless martyr who just wanted to get her daughter help. Most doctors assumed the story was somewhere in the middle, but when one side is saying their daughter is a drug addicted alchoholic homicidal prostitute who wants to run away to NYC with debilitating social anxiety, odd, depression, bipolar disorder, adhd and general anxiety and the other side is saying there's nothing wrong except for abusive parents, when what do you believe? My mom also told this story to countless relatives and her friends, practically ruining my reputation and making me afraid to go to family gatherings now.

When the hospital released me, she started sending me to all sorts of special schools telling exaggerated lies to get me kept there longer. (She has her bags packed and by the door, she wants to run away, she tried to spill boiling hot coffee all over my husband...aka... she told me I could stay at my grandparents for a few weeks, my dad has tried to kick me out and my dad started grabbing me while he was holding a mug of coffee and it spilled) . Her lies eventually ended up getting me almost sent to residential treatment as well. When one school thought I was okay, she would just send me to another.

Cps has investigated too, but when it's her and my siblings saying one thing (and ending up getting money for a new phone and a guitar a few days after they talked to cps) and me saying another, a handful of pictures of bruises didn't matter.

I've talked this over with my friends/ their parents to make sure I'm not being unreasonable, and they all have taken my side, since my mom has been rude to them in the past, threatened to call cps on them to retaliate after they saw me with bruises and called, and even though my mom is telling everyone my friends are bad influences (don't gossip, do drugs, get home at 10pm latest, don't drink, drive safetly, ect) I'm super greatful to them as they've practically adopted me as a second daughter. My parents are threatening to take all my money, so my friend's parents are helping me open a seperate bank account, multiple families have offered to let me live with them, and they've offered to help me get my license.

Even now they use the threat of residential treatment as an excuse to hold onto all my bank documents, make me clean up after them, and treat me a lot worse than my siblings, one of which has actual disabilities. They can't physically hurt me anymore, so they're resulting to being emotionally manipulative. Getting memberships to the gym I work at just to watch me work, giving me rides to work and harassing me ""don't you think you're mentally ill? we just want to get you help and you're being so ungreatful. Tell me you need it. Do you want me to leave you on the side of the road?""

A few times a week at least I have nightmares of them calling the police on me (which has happened) or someone coming to take me away in the middle of the night to go to residential inpatient because I wasn't good enough. I feel like every time I'm talking to them, I'm putting on some sort of show just to placate them.

Anyway, I don't want to make this even longer, but do you guys think it would be a good idea to go no contact? Would there be a way to talk to some of my relatives in the future without my parents trying to use that to come see me?",TW Physical Violence

Is this physical abuse?,6,"Over the past few years my husband has slapped, kicked, and bit me multiple times. In most cases though, he wasn‚Äôt angry per se? He has kicked me in the legs, sometimes leaving bruises, bit me in the arms, and slapped me in the arms, thighs, and butt, often times hard enough to leave a mark.

I have told him that it hurts and to stop each time, and he would backtrack and say he didn‚Äôt mean to hit that hard, or it was just a joke and he wanted my attention. This didn‚Äôt stop it from repeating though. Sometimes he would hit out of annoyance, because I was biting my nails which he didn‚Äôt like or because I told a joke he didn‚Äôt like.

Support dealing with false accusations of domestic violence,13,"Hello,

My spouse is pregnant and recently falsely accused me of domestic violence. This is our first child. She called the police, who believed her lies, and I got arrested. She has refused to lift the no contact and is moving forward with the charges. There is no evidence, because I did not do anything. It‚Äôs literally her word against mine and the police sided with her, I believe because she‚Äôs a woman and pregnant. 

Yes, our relationship was struggling but I have never abused anyone, ever. She had been mentally, emotionally and physically abusing me for years (telling me I‚Äôm constantly wrong, forgetful, attacking my tastes, who I am, slapping me, throwing water on me). When I put my foot down, she called the police. Based on my research, this is typical behavior of a narcissistic abuser. Once they lose control, they destroy the situation or escalate the situation so they can maintain control. 

As I opened up about my story to friends and family, I began to learn that false accusations of DV is more common than I thought.

But I am not able to find support groups for people dealing with false accusations of DV. I need help. Who has gone through this situation before? How did your situation pan out? Any advice?",TW Physical Violence

My ex-wife abused me,5,"So I dont tell this story lightly. Before I begin I would like to say that there may be some trigger warning stuff in here so if your sensitive to that just dont read it. Also I say when I was a man which im a trans woman so that means when I identified as a man. 

It all began in law school. I had been there attending when I thought I fell in love with my ex-wife. She was smart, brilliant etc. We married in 2000 and had 2 kids together. However she began being angry and abusing me physically and emotionally. She would yell and scream at me when I did something she didn't like. She would dig her sharp fingernails into my skin. She would slap me. She would force me to have sex with her even if I didn't feel like it. I put up with it for our kids who were young and needed 2 parent support. What she did constitutes as physical and emotional abuse. I had an affair with a male co-worker of mine which pissed her off immensely when she found out in 2006. She yelled, she screamed, she threw things at me. Put her hand around my throat. By the way I wasn't fighting her back because I knew how domestic violence cases against men were ignored and even laughed at by police. And I was not much taller than her at 5'5 myself and her just I would say half an inch shorter. I made a run for it. I wasn't going to be killed. I got her hand off my throat. She got a heel and stabbed me though I didn't feel it. I ran towards the stairs. And she pushed me I know she did. I went falling down the stairs. I suffered a concussion, lacerations on my face and body some of which needed stitches, a broken arm and a sprained foot. I lied and said I fell down the stairs. I didn't want to be humiliated by the police nor did I want to take my kids mother away. In a way I still had loved her. It would result in a 3 year legal battle which she stubbornly wanted as much as she could take. The kids, the house every single thing. I had to fight and fight to even get visitation rights. She threatened me with texts, bombarded my house phone so much I had to move far away from her. I filed for a restraining order which I did receive. Eventually we divorced in 2009 and me traumatized. I couldn't talk about it cause at the time I identified as a man. Its dragged on me for over a decade. Though moving out West. Though another marriage to a man. Though visits with the kids. Though moving back east and starting my gender transition. Its left me numb. I have never come back from this and probably never will. I was abused and people mock it.

Need advice NC domestic violence can I still file a report?,4,I left my abusive ex boyfriend about 2 years ago and I was told by someone I trusted I couldn't make a report or press charges 3 months or more after it happened and at the time he knew where I lived so I didnt press charges or take out a restraining order in fear of retaliation. He has no idea where I live now and a girl I know told me he threatened her on multiple occasions recently and she refuses to go to the police. All I want to do is put in a report so that there's some type of domestic violence reported in his past and hopefully that would help his next victim when she reaches out for help. Can I do this in north carolina and it come up in his record at all without pressing charges? I don't have sufficient evidence of his abuse if I would take pictures or write things down he would find them. All his messages are on an old cellphone I don't have anymore and he's blocked on everything so I have no messages to bring forth unless I were to unblock his snapchat and pull that up which I really don't want to do.

I think I've made my decision to file for a divorce. Just felt like sharing it with this community for some support,11,"I have been separated from my formerly abusive husband for the better part of a year now. There used to be physical and psychological abuse in addition to some problems to which my personal struggles contributed. He has seemingly changed and looked for help and is extremely sorry for what he put me through and I am starting therapy soon to process it all further. Still, the fact that I basically spent my entire adult life so far in an abusive relationship has distorted my sense of self a lot, and being all alone with my trauma for years (until last spring) was very painful. Even though he's not controlling or violent anymore I don't think I can or want to try to restore my trust in him. It wouldn't even be fair for him to stay together if I'm not able to really trust him and still hold my grudges. The violence was never brutal or constant, but it still left its marks on me, fear and emotional pain in addition to some minor injuries.

I have been weighing my options for a year now, and the thought of me being able to live a full life without him or even in another relationship is still so new. In addition I have felt like as he's changed I should try to give him a chance and process my feelings in order to provide him a good marriage. But finally I start to fully realize that it is not my responsibility, he has broken my mind multiple times and I now am able to push the sense of responsibility aside, realizing that the life I want to live doesn't involve him anymore.

I want to be free and heal by myself and experience my adulthood unbound by violence or a marriage that is more based on practicalities than actual romantic love. I do realize that I will be mourning and doubting the divorce for some time and probably will have second thought during the process, but am hopeful that my independence will persist and provide a meaningful life for myself.",TW Physical Violence
I‚Äôm dating a maniac? He roughed up this morning for waking him up! Please give me strength and truth,6,"So I‚Äôve posted before about my boyfriend the recently divorced recovering alcoholic. I‚Äôve been really struggling to end it and get away but he has been on his best behavior since my last post and I somehow forget all the crazy. he‚Äôs going to therapy trying to exhibit healthy responses to his anger and work through his horribly abusive childhood. So far he‚Äôs been doing a fantastic job until today. 

He has been going through some rough times financially and other various personal stresses and asked if I would sleep over at his place because he needed me tonight.  Side note He REALLY wants me to move in with him and it‚Äôs a point of contention but TBH I‚Äôm really not ready to do that as I just got out of a 8 year controlling relationship 
not too long ago.

I told him I could sleep over but he‚Äôd have to pick me up on his way home as my car is in the shop and if he didn‚Äôt mind I had to be back at my place fairly early because I had a lot I needed to get done the next day plus i was watching my neighbors dog and I wanted to give her an early morning walk etc. he agreed, and the next morning my alarm went off and I didn‚Äôt hear it right away and he just yells TURN IT OFF, turn it the FUCK off. I kinda laughed it off got up and shut it down but I was obviously up for the day so I kinda started to gently but kind of annoyingly say wakeup wake up wake as up, Which is normally met with playfulness as I am a morning person and he is not. So this time I thought he was just playing back but I guess I misread because he was actually really annoyed. Then he started telling me to go back to sleep which is when I started to get pissed. 

So I laid quiet for 5 minutes then I said OK really now it‚Äôs time to get up you agreed if I slept here you‚Äôd drive me home early so please GET UP. He called me a bitch and started kind of getting rough with me and was forcing my hands behind my back and pushing my face into the bed and yelling ‚ÄúYou spoiled Guinea brat‚Äù he was quoting The Godfather where Carlo beats up Connie with a belt . Worst part is he pulls up the scene afterwards and is LAUGHING AT IT. and just keeps yelling and calling me a guinea Brat, blah blah I‚Äôm a spoiled guinea bitch.

Fuckin self defense? Huh? So when I‚Äôm not around you can protect Yourself since your so fuckin independent.

Did I do the right thing?,7,"
So my sister and I used to get until I was in middle school. One day we were arguing at my aunts house and she just exploded and started grabbing my hair and hitting me. She had never done anything like that before. She did it a couple more times over the next couple years. Blowing up and beating me crazily whenever she was angry at me. I couldn‚Äôt do much about at and at most my parents told her to stop but no real punishments.

Moving on to last year. Our relationship improved a bit and even though I never forgave her for what she did, I was willing to try and get along for the sake of family. I sit her down to talk to her about what happened and she states that she‚Äôs not sorry and that she was in the right. I still chose to try and get along for the sake of peace.

Just two days ago, I was visiting her at her apartment. We were getting along fine until we went out one day. She grabbed onto my arms as we crossed the street and I told her to stop doing that. This infuriated her and she started ranting about how people die and get hit by cars and how she always holds onto her friends when they cross. I told her that was great and all but I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable. She stomps away angrily and I go for a walk to cool my head. As I walk back to her apartment, she‚Äôs there waiting for me. She starts yelling at me and berating me; telling me that as long as I‚Äôm here I‚Äôll listen to whatever she says and will answer yes without questioning her. we reach her apartment, she corners me in her closet and tells me I‚Äôm going to listen to her rules. I tell her that I don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm wont come back so she doesn‚Äôt need to tell me her rules. I then tell her that I‚Äôm 18 and she needs to start treating me like an adult. She then strikes me in the face, push me to the floor, grab my hair and repeatedly kick me in the stomach + groin. She eventually gets off me and screams that I‚Äôm leaving now. Angry, I yell curses at her. I tell her I hope she dies, that she‚Äôs a cunt and a bitch and that she‚Äôs a piece of shit. I made the mistake of approaching her while yelling all this at her and she proceeds to start hitting me again. This time I fought back with equal strength and did some damage on her as well. As I pack my stuff,I tell her I‚Äôm disowning her as a sister and filing assault charges against her. 

There‚Äôs knocking on the door. Turned out the neighbors call the police. I immediately tell them that she had been assaulting me as soon as they ask what happened. They escort me out, ask some questions and leave after I told them I was catching a ride home. Even when I got home I was still furious and informed my family through our groupchat that I was filing charges still and emailing her school. I‚Äôve done both as of today and of course my dad is absolutely pissed. Everyone has been ignoring me but I‚Äôve already made up my mind to go through with the charges.",TW Physical Violence

I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that was the hardest night of my life. He wanted me to kill myself and he wasn't going to stop until I cracked and did it. He shocked even me in how low he went, threatening to rape the women in my life amongst other awful stuff. 

I called a friend around 8am because I couldn't cope anymore and she came to help me leave. He spent the entire morning telling everyone how abusive I've been to him and how evil and unstable I am. I think my mum (ex law enforcement) handled it best when she stared him in the eye and just said ""don't"". He looked like someone had waxed his testicles.

She immediately said no with no explanation as to why, when I asked why, she became agitated and began to yell for me to leave after saying the car is hers now, I never entered the room only stood at the door, then when I did not leave and continued to ask politely ""please could you give me the keys to the car so I can go to the shop for 10 minutes and I'll be back"" she then jumped from her bed, ran over to me, while yelling at me to leave and slammed the door on my face and shoulder, as I was between the doorway, I continued to be calm but did not move and repeated why can't I have the keys, she then elbowed me in the stomach a couple of times and continued screaming at the top of her lungs for me to get out of the room, during this I did not raise my voice or touch her back at all, but refused to be intimidated and leave without the keys.

She then started screaming that I was using my physical strength against her, because I was not moving from the doorway, which is when I started walking back and saying I'm not touching you and you've hit me multiple times, she continued to scream how I was physically intimidating her and slammed the door shut. I was angry lost my temper and slammed the door back open and without entering the room as she was still standing at the door, and tried to snatch the keys from her hand with my hand, but failed to snatch them instead grasping her closed hand and then immediately letting go and then walked away because I could see I had lost my temper.

She then yelled after me and threatening to call the police on me, and told me she was calling our dad, which she did do and proceeded to tell him that I came into her room, grabbed her and pulled her arm behind her back and tried to force her to give me the keys to the car. Very fortunately, because this is not the first time it has happened like this with her, I was recording the whole thing which was unknown to her when she called him. Also if that was true and I was willing to do that, I would certainly have been able to get the keys, which I never did get.

To give context, she has no reason to fear me as I have never attacked her or threatened her in anyway, I am larger than her but she is not small she is 5'11"" and an adult, she claims she does not remember our dad ever being violent but he was when we were little, and it is for that reason that I am especially cautious with women because I understand how a larger man can intimidate a women without actually touching them, as he intimidated me in that way when I was a small boy, we are both young adults now.

Because of what I have seen my father do to my mother, older sister, and myself, I am very aware of my size and strength and am extremely cautious when in a confrontation with a women. I have protected her all her life from her older sister who is very physically violent, but only to the extent that I separate them when they are fighting, I have only ever hit a women once in my life when I was 13 and my older sister had scissors and was attacking my mum and I feared for her life as she was swinging them at her violently, and at this time my older sister was bigger than me, ever since I grew much larger than her I only ever restrained her when she attacked my mother or sister, getting her to focus on her breath and letting her go when she calmed down, which both my little sister and mother would often scream out for me to come help by doing when she attacked them, and were always thankful for after the fact.

I'm sure some might think I am biased in the way I am sharing this story, but I am being as honest and fair as possible in my recounting of what happened, I do not want to share the recording because of personal information was exchanged during the confrontation. It doesn't help me to lie at any rate as I would like to hear what people think. My mother, and my little sisters boyfriend are completely against me, my little sister is my mothers favourite child and it seems she can do no wrong in her eyes, it has always been this way, her BF just saw the damaged door and heard what she told him about it and is of course biased anyway being her boyfriend and not wanting to be against her. He refused to watch the recording, and my mother also says the same, she is not interested. My dad who's opinion I could hardly care less about in this matter did watch it and agreed in the end that she was in the wrong, he does not live with us though and does not speak to my mother.

I believe she knew what she was doing, not wanting to give me the car keys (as the night before I had called her selfish with the car and she was angry about that) she was using the stigma of men being the aggressor to control the situation, she was crying wolf essentially, in my view.",TW Physical Violence
The Day I Fought Back--RANT,6,"A couple months ago he had taken my key without my knowing and entered while I was asleep. He came in immediately accusing me of cheating and asking who was in my place. He was my nextdoor neighbor. I was startled and frightened and I screamed for him to leave immediately. I was so frustrated by the lack of sleep I had endured for days. He banged on the wall at odd hours. I told him I had enough of his antics and we were over and he needed to leave immediately. I screamed ""I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE"" 

I tried pushing him with my body weight out of my room to no avail. He's huge. He slapped me with his non-dominant hand. My ears were ringing. I was yelling. He tried to restrain me. I bit him in the upper arm whilst in his grasp. He threw me onto my bed and I got back up and he launched me again. I fell hard and was winded. I told him he was making me want to die. I was crying hysterically and crawling on the ground. He also pinned me down on the ground on my back and would not get off for an extended period. I was screaming ""get off"" ""Get out"" and ""help."" He was telling me to be quiet because of the neighbors and tried covering my mouth. I managed to get an arm loose and hit him in the mouth while he was on top of me and he retracted. He's 265 lbs 6'4 and I am 108 5'3. I yelled again for him to leave. I tried to run out and began yelling in the hall. He pulled me back in and told me to be quiet. He took my medicine and supplement bin and tried running out and leaving with it (convinced I was going to commit suicide by medicine??). I wasn't going to let him steal from me and used my body weight and clung to his leg like a child would and he stumbled a bit and I managed to knock it out of his arms and the bottles, plastic and glass, flew all over. At one point he was dragging me across the carpet and another he slapped me with his dominant hand so hard I fell onto my back on the tile in a daze. I laid there amongst all the broken bottles and don't know exactly how long. I do know I was moaning. I was dizzy and saw weird spots in my vision. Next I know--He took a video on MY phone of me once I had gotten up and I was in my night dress holding my head in a daze weakly saying ""call the cops, call the cops"" and ""you're hurting me! stop pulling my hair."" In the video he is verbally asserting I was attempting suicide and I was crazy and he was trying to stop me. This, I assume, is him constructing an excuse for the whole thing and also some kind of blackmail or whatever it is. He told me I have mental issues. He said we would both go to jail for this and not to call the cops. I didn't know he had a current warrant for not paying past due probation dues for a felony. I didn't call the cops out of fear because I did fight back and he was afraid of going back to prison. He said he would fight the cops and make them kill him instead of going back to prison again. I felt guilt for fighting back...He left and saw cops outside. He told me not to open the door.

I had awful, big purple and blue bruises on both my upper arms and wrists from him grabbing me. Throwing me. Hitting me. My face was welted on both sides. Carpet burns on my legs from being dragged. Somehow I got a bruise on my bum. My nail broke. Some of this encounter is a blur. It went on for quite some time. He had a bite mark on his arm and a cut on the inside of his mouth/lip.

I had never been in an abusive relationship before. Since this day I had been fed up and put up a fight after enduring multiple physical abuses prior I decided not to fight back again in fear he'd try holding it against me, plus I believe it made it worse, but his abuse, physical and otherwise, continued. Though it hasn't been this bad. Yes, it's still bad. And yes, I still get bruises and slapped very hard. I assume he slaps because it doesn't bruise your face. That would be too obvious.

Lately I am quiet when he yells. I tune him out. I zone out. I don't respond. I disassociate. He continues to provoke. I don't eat nor sleep properly. My eye twitches. He tells me I have eating disorders and sleep problems and I am mental. He says I am the problem.

* Partner hovers over my shoulder and grabs my phone any time I touch it. He's smashed and completely broken my phone recently and also took my ipad and I had no outside contact. This usually stems from accusing me of cheating with no reason.
* He picked up my bed and smashed it--breaking the wooden frame. I had to throw it out.
* He put holes in my doors and walls. Smashed a hole through both sides of a door to the bathroom.
* He breaks my belongings. My table. My marble tray. My plant pot. My phone. Never his items.
* He constantly accuses me of cheating with or talking to exes, to neighbors, to anyone really
* I am not ""allowed"" to go to the restroom alone. He always comes in and has broken locks on all doors.
* He constantly tells me I'm worthless and I don't do enough for him nor the relationship. He says it's my fault he's angry with me. He tells me he can do better. He threatens sleeping with other women. He says if I leave he will f them in the bed. I respond ""okay""
* I have told him he's abusive and he tells me he only reacts because I have a bad attitude and negativity around me. It's my fault. I'm a bitch and a cunt and I don't appreciate him enough. I don't do enough to make him feel loved. If I were ""nicer"" he would treat me better. If I knew his love language he wouldn't be angry. I don't fill his love tank.
* He will yell and put me down for hours then switches tune to try to make up or make love. When I am not interested or tell him I'm still upset about earlier he tells me I never ""allow"" him to be nice and I don't let things go. It's my fault. He goes back into a rage immediately.
* He doesn't let me leave home when I try to escape. He chases me down and pulls me back in or stands in doorways. He also corners me in rooms or corners and towers over me. 
* I try to stay in separate rooms but am in constant fear he will come in and torment me. He usually does on average of twice a day and each rant lasts at least 2 hours. He cycles between yelling and crying in hysterics feeling sorry for himself and guilt tripping. Saying I don't love him.
* When I am in the car with him he will start arguments and I feel I'm held hostage. He won't let me out of the car. He drives erratically. I once yelled ""HELP"" out the window to passersby and he pulled me in by my hair and neck and struck me in the face.
* He sometimes keeps me awake or deprives me of sleep with arguments for many nights in a row even when I don't respond (or say, ""okay. okay. Yes. Okay."") and has sabotaged my schedules involving work or visiting family.

Now I won't be alone with him and keep company over constantly. They know about this.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Need advice,9,"Need some advice before I make a big move. My fianc√© is very violent and abusive towards me. I have video of him punching me and pictures of bruises from where he has attacked me over the span of two years. I‚Äôve finally had enough. He hit me so badly that I ended up in the ER with severe back pain. Lied about how I got my pain of course so there‚Äôs no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù documentation of abuse. He has held a gun to my head multiple times and threatened to kill me. He has also threatened my dog. He‚Äôs threatened to shoot me if I called the police and threatened to kill my dog as well if I did. Unfortunately I have no proof of the dog threats. But I do have video of him screaming and beating me and the dog barking and cowering beside me on the floor. Legally the dog is his, he bought the dog and pays for vet bills, pet insurance, etc. My name is on grooming appointments and his vet records. I fear leaving the dog with him when I make my escape. He has already said I cannot have the dog if I leave. I‚Äôm considering just taking the dog with me when I leave for his and my safety. I am the main caregiver of the dog and have witnesses to prove that I walk him and care for him. I‚Äôm sure he will drag me to court to get him back.

First time he ever put his hands on me,5,"Today 5/6,two days before my 25th birthday  my m(29) bf put his hands on me f(24) for the first time. After a small argument he yelled an inch from my face then shoved me after I pushed him away from me. When I got back up I pushed him (similar to pushing a sled in football) he‚Äôs 250lbs by the way he shoved me harder. At this time I tried to swing on him. I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this so I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Looking back I should‚Äôve just walked away the minute he got in my face.I didn‚Äôt follow through with the punch because the word ‚Äúlawsuit‚Äù popped in my head. After that he grabbed me by the collar of my hoodie and pulled me to his face like a bully in search of lunch money. I was shocked. I immediately left. Grabbed my 6yo daughter who thankfully was in her room with the tv just loud enough to drown us out. I‚Äôm in search of advice and if this really is considered domestic abuse or violence.

"A guy [m, 40] that I [f, 23] am seeing is very abusive [violence, murder], and I'm scared. Help me.",16,"**TW: Emotional, physical, sexual abuse & abuse threats.** 

This is a long story. Last year, I got into a sexual relationship with this man. It lasted for a few months. Luckily, he lives in another city (close to me), and the pandemic in my country makes it difficult to see each other often these days. He was sexually degrading, but we were both consenting. We had a falling out, and about 8 months later, I reached out to him again. It's been half a year now since we are talking. 

At first, he was very sweet and caring to me, intelligent and handsome, but it has gotten worse and worse. We aren't together, and he knew I had fallen for him. We were sexual with each other a handful of times, and we spend a lot of time texting, calling, and video chatting. Two months in, he started telling me when to go to sleep and grew violently jealous towards my friends or any guy I was getting along with. Then, the few times we were sexting, he told me he will rape me, but I thought it was just a roleplay fantasy. 

Once, he mentioned how he wants to beat someone to death over a small dispute, thinking it was justified, which terrified me, and I told him it's wrong, and he made it seem like a joke. Then recently, he insisted on spending even more time with me. A few times in person, but mostly over the phone/streaming. It was sweet at first and so innocent. We were watching shows and movies together at night. Only quite recently I realised that he is masturbating without my consent while watching these shows with me, and a lot of them are cartoons, which is even weirder. 

That was also around the time he started telling me he will punch and slap me. He seems to be obsessed with my height (he is way, way taller than me). He told me I should be sure he will do that, how he will punch my light's out, slap me whenever he feels like it. 

A week ago, he wanted to call me, and I told him to give me five minutes to which he responded that I should hurry up or he will kill me, then he said it's just a joke because he'll strangle me instead. That was just a day before he got drunk for seemingly no reason (he used other drugs before, but he usually hates drinking) until I put two and two together and realised it must have been because he got jealous of me spending time with my friend that day (he saw it on social media) and not reaching out to him. 

That night, he said very disturbing things including how he has sex with women and then kills them, and then changed that to saying that he meant he will kill me and that friend because I am not giving him the attention he wants. 

Other instances that stand out regularly:

* He tries to isolate me from my friends so only the friends he can control/manipulate/has on his side are around. 
* He gets very upset whenever my phone vibrates, telling me to turn off my notifications in an intimidating way.
* He told me he will rape me multiple times.
* He gets upset when I seem to be replying to someone else or seem busy. 
* He mocks me often.
* He constantly says I'm younger than I am (think about 10 years younger than my current age).
* He suddenly turns into this very nice guy whenever he fears rejection from me or tells me not to dare to ever talk to him again that way.
* He has mood swings. One day, he is nice. The next day, he is angry. 
* The idea of the slightest rejection makes him hostile towards me, whereas just a year ago, he couldn't care less.
* He tried to hack my computer and find out where my parents are living. 

Just five days ago, he attempted to make me jealous with a female friend of his on his birthday. It truly hurt my feelings, and every time another male friend was trying to talk to me, he didn't let him finish his sentence and interrupted our conversation. He didn't care with her, though. 

Anyway, it ended with me leaving and telling him to never talk to me again to which he seemed very upset, saying I have mental issues. That night, he called me, and I had taken the medication I got prescribed from my psychiatrist (so I was very hazed out). He seemed worried, saying I sound like I ate a whole box of valium, telling me I can't go to sleep because I can die or something like that. I was very hazed out, but I am pretty sure he was masturbating again because I heard him moan one too many times. 

I told him I don't want to talk to him ever again; he was upset, saying I need to go to sleep immediately, and he won't talk to me anymore for the night. I think the last message I sent to him was an emotional one, and he told me that I'm the coolest person he has ever met and how I shouldn't leave him for too long because he likes me a lot and wants to spend a lot of time with me. He never does that. I didn't respond since then. 

Basically, I'm in a really bad situation, and I feel like he already brainwashed me enough for me to stay for this long. But I'm getting more and more scared by the day, and he made it clear he doesn't accept me 'leaving' him. He constantly tells me he will slap me and gets jealous of the most ridiculous things, even of animals. I am shaking as I'm typing this. He makes me feel so powerless and messes with my mind. I'm mostly worried because of all the personal info, pictures, and the need for keeping tabs on me he has, and how depressed and violent he turns.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Sound Torture and a secret countdown.,27,"Tonight's abuse is brought to me by dubstep. He's had the speaker on the stairs, full blast, playing the same 4 second sound on a loop. Just to fuck with me. 

I never thought I could hate dubstep this much. Actually no, dubstep isn't that great, it's not a leap to go from mild dislike to hatred. 

I have a little countdown that he doesn't know about which is making it all bearable. I've got a van booked. I've got two chaps arriving very soon and they're going to carry all my little belongings into their van, and then they're going to drive them away to my new home. And he won't know what's happening until I open that front door to them. 

So he can play his dubstep, he can goad me by blowing smoke at me. And I'll play the injured doe, crying and broken. But I know I'm going. And in a few days I'll be falling asleep in a bed he will never find.",Preparing To Leave

He's just left the house crying because he knows I'll take the cat when I leave. I've been with him for years and I think he's only cried four times. 

I feel evil. I feel so evil. I can't pack. I can't do anything. I don't want to go but I know I have to. Everything is too much. I don't think I can do it. How can he be the bad one when I'm the one causing all this pain. I can't deal with this.",Preparing To Leave
Pregnant attorney is a victim of my brother - help,2,"I would like advice about how best to support my SIL who is being physically abused by my brother, she is in her 30s, is pregnant, has no family but my family is very wealthy and in denial about him as a batterer even though he abused his first wife and was kicked out of university for it.   She owns a house that he lives in but he is in and out of jobs due to his criminal record, he abuses drugs and in this incident when the police were called she has not pressed charges because she believes he is making progress on his addiction and doesn‚Äôt want to set him back/reject him.  I can tell she loves him very much.  But I‚Äôm so worried about her safety.  She is a very private person and has already let him back into the home, he is a narcissist and thinks he is smarter than everyone else so I can see him trying to hurt her and get away with it if she threatens to leave him.

----------

I've tried to keep it secret but he knows I'm leaving. I'm in England. 

He's already threatening to go to the police with videos of me ""being crazy and kicking off"". He's been holding this over my head for two years, he pushes and pushes and pushes until I snap, he encourages me to kill myself and then videos my meltdowns so he can blackmail me and discredit me. I have never been smart enough to record him when he's beaten me, and I've never reported. 

I am so scared. He wants money I don't have. He wants my cat. He wants me to call the police and give a statement that he's never harmed me and I'm the aggressor. Unless I submit to his demands he's going to take the videos to the police. 

The neighbours called the police two years ago when I was screaming for my life. He had hurt me so much and then started choking me, I bit down and scratched him to try and escape. When the police came I was so scared of what he'd do that I lied and said he hadn't hurt me, it had just been verbal, the neighbours over reacted. Meanwhile he apparently showed them the bite Mark and the scratches, said I was insane, they told him to have me arrested but he played the white knight and said he didn't want to get me in trouble. 

He's set the scene already. I'm so fucking scared. 
He's got all the power and I don't know what to do. He's going to ruin my life. He's set me up, he's told everyone he works with I'm unstable, I'm on medication for mental health issues, I'm off work because they've got bad. He's shown his family the videos and said I beat him. On paper he's a poor man working full time and supporting a crazy violent bitch. He's been holding this over my head as a threat, every time I've said the slightest thing about him hurting me he's laughed about having all the evidence and me having none. 

I feel boxed in. Like there's no way out. I'm lying in bed sobbing because he's won. I was so fucking stupid to think I could leave.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

My Abuse Story,8,"I was dating a man for 5 1/2 years. He wasn't always  mean. Usually it would escalate when he was drunk, which was a lot near the ending. The abuse lasted years.

The verbal; calling me a bitch almost daily. I mentioned once how cunt is probably one of the worst words to use. So it became ""bitch-cunt"" near daily for years. I remember thinking it was a good day when he hadn't called me that. 

Isolation; telling me I had no friends. I was boring, and ugly, fat. Telling me, ""You suck."" And, ""You're so dumb/stupid."" was a common occurrence.

The physical; shoving me. Pushing me down, but making sure to do it on a soft surface so I wouldn't bruise. If we weren't near one, He would grab me by the shoulders, and steer me as I was forced to walked backwards until I was over a couch/bed then push me down. If I stood up, he would push me down. Each time more violently. Again and again until I stayed down. 

Once he tried to drop me on our concrete floors. The only thing that saved me was that I physically pushed back, so he couldn't knock me down. He had told me many times before about how he and his ex, T, had physically abused each other. I now wonder if it was just him abusing her, and her resisting. And he changed the narrative to justify his own behavior.

Whipping me with earbuds. Ripping things out of my hands. Digging his elbow into me deep. Flicking my face. Kicking me. Whistling and singing tunes repeatedly just to annoy me. Demanding things from me I wasn't comfortable doing. Shaming me and throwing fits for not doing said thing. 

He felt that me asking him to do normal things was a challenge, and would purposefully avoid those things until I did them. Things like picking up his dirty clothes from the ground, bathroom etiquette, feeding the animals, etc. In retrospect he was testing my boundaries.

The abuse would always happen when I would disagree with, or challenge something he wanted or said or did. It was clear that it was his way, or no way.

After he would hurt me he would say things like, ""Sorry, but you just made me so mad. If you hadn't made me so mad....""

Of course none of this would ever happen around others. He's popular, and well liked in our town. And honestly I was great at hiding things because of the way I was raised. He picked the perfect victim. I began liking spending time at his family's house partly because he was decent there. 

Near the end his drinking became worse, and so the abuse escalated. I remember feeling like I was certain he was going to kill me. Maybe on accident, maybe even on purpose. 

One night he slapped me on my face so hard I heard my heartbeat pounding in my ear. If you're wondering why, it's because Netflix wasn't working. I felt so deeply that I needed help. So I called the police and he was arrested for domestic violence. 

Make no mistake. This was not a ""fight."" I was in the shower when he first verbally attacked me then escalated to throwing my phone and finally hitting me. 

After seeing a doctor for my painful jaw, inner ear, and emotional wounds, I was told that if he had hit me more over my ear, the air force could have ruptured my ear drum, and I'd be deaf. I was also told had he hit me an inch or two higher, I probably would have gone to sleep and not have woken up. He could have ended my life because he was upset about Netflix.

Hi,


I don't know if we've met, but I was The Girl Before You‚Ä¶¬†


I was the girl he likely told you was crazy, psycho or something else that made you never want to reach out to me.¬†


I was the girl that he told, that his ex could never get over him. He told me about how his family still loved his ex, despite that he broke up with her. He was furious that they still occasionally spoke with her. He was upset that his ex was still around despite him leaving her. I found out that this wasn‚Äôt true as well because she left him.


We went to his mom's house a little before Christmas and I was beyond financially broke. When I say I was, it was because he managed the finances. He made sure that I was beyond strapped every single paycheck. We split the bills but I somehow had no money to my name month after month. We showed up to his moms house to do gingerbread cookies. We decorated them and someone had burned a few. We were leaving his mom's house and he said that we were going to pick up a pizza. I told him I thought we were leaving. I was getting tired and wanted to leave. He said we aren't leaving. Everyone was getting ready to watch a movie but I was exhausted. I said goodnight to everyone and we started to go to the car. As soon as we get to the car, he begins shouting and screaming at me inside the car. I tell him I don't have money for food and he shouldn't have volunteered me buying dinner since he knew I was broke. He was shouting so loud inside my car that his family was looking outside the window. He grabbed my arm so hard and kept telling me to drive to get dinner. I swear if I could have left him there and packed my things that night, I would have left him then. I think he knew it and that's why he wouldn't let me leave. I started heading towards home while having a panic attack. I told him I am going straight home, nowhere else. I am broke, exhausted and wouldn't be able to pay for parking or gas for work. When we got to the light to head to the freeway, I got in the lane to head home and not to pizza. That is when he grabbed the wheel so hard that I almost wrecked into the cement median. He pulled my hair and steered us at the median. I began to scream and sob. He was assaulting me in my new car. I should have pulled my gun on him. I should have driven to the police station, but I stayed. I figured a couple more days or one small opening of time and I will make my exit. We got pizza and acted like nothing had happened. He made me come in, not leave his side and apologize for taking so long. He made ME apologize for him raising his voice in my car.¬†


There was a night with my co-workers after Christmas. It was a night out with my amazing friends that I got the privilege to work with. We went out for drinks and did a gift exchange. We spent hours laughing and talking. It was that night that I felt the strength to leave him. My friend Jessica was talking, she was telling a story and my phone was being blown up by him. I must have gotten like 100 text messages before her story ended. We were having dinner, drinking and relaxing. This was a night that was planned and cleared by him weeks prior. He then began demanding that I get home and get home now. I came home hours later. I didn't want to leave the real me behind. I didn't want her to go away. I knew in my heart that she had to stay.¬†


Did you know that his aunt asked me if he was hurting me? She said that his ex left him for the abuse and she liked me so she wanted to make sure he wasn't harming me. Then that very same night, I suffered a miscarriage and he was furious that I needed to go to the hospital. He screamed and screamed at me for making my bleeding out and losing our child, about me. He never sat by my side. He never went through the pain with me. If he could make me shameful and small, then he wouldn't have to worry about me doing it again, right?¬†


Did you know that his sister once came to me and asked me if he was hurting me? At the time he was but how was I supposed to tell her yes? What would she have done? Who would she have made me out to be? She mentioned that his ex left him and she thought his ex was being hurt.¬†


When I went through another miscarriage, I called my mom crying saying I needed support while I was at the hospital and he screamed at me for telling anyone. My mom's boyfriend at the time almost fought him because he was being so disrespectful. I went through 4 miscarriages and he was not by my side a single time.¬†


He forced me to stay home and suffer the fourth miscarriage at home. I wasn't allowed to go to the hospital because he was sure I was going to tell someone that he wasn't going to be along my side again. I bled so much and had so much pain that I was blacking out. I would wake up and the time had flown by and I was still there laying beside the toilet. It took me almost a week before the pain stopped. I have trauma associated with this all the time. I should have gotten medical attention but I was forced to be home and suffer in silence.¬†


Did he share with you that he discharged his gun inside our apartment? Did he tell you that his best friend was there and that he made us all promise not to tell that he did this? This was just one of the many things he lied about.¬†Did he tell you that he threatened to kill me with his gun so that's why I have ALWAYS owned mine? 


There was a pounding on our door one night. After hours of being yelled at and screamed at. After being told I was nothing and being called every name in the book, a white knight came to the door. The police showed up and the coward hid in our room. He hid and pretended that he was sleeping when the police showed up. They asked about a domestic dispute and he told me to lie. He told me to tell them that he was even up late vomiting and that he vomits loud. I think I even posted about it on Facebook to sell myself on it too.¬†


You deserve better than him. You deserve someone that will never put a woman down. You deserve a man that will love you with everything he has, doesn't change what you want out of life and is willing to commit to you. You deserve a man that will never put his hands on you, no matter what.¬†


I saw a side to me that I never thought I would see. I was so ugly and so mean. I was alienated from my family and my friends. I wasn't allowed to have friends outside of what he accepted. Any time that I wanted to paint rocks or go to a concert, he lost his mind. I defended myself and that made me turn into an ugly person. I pray that you never have to be the woman I was when I was with him.¬†


Despite all of the red flags with this man, I stayed. I saw the charm and I cherished all the good days. I thought that the next day couldn't be worse than the last. I thought that maybe more time with him would make him love me. Maybe more time with him would mean he would stop wanting to see me hurt.


The day I left, he had just yelled at me and made me feel so small. I was playing on the computer he built for my birthday, celebrating paying off the bed that I always wanted but was a small fortune ($6k sleep number bed) and he lost it. I'm not sure why he lost his temper but he did.


Him losing his temper and being so awful to me triggered something in me that had been stowed away for a long time. I imagined all of those times where I needed him to be better and he wasn't, where I needed him to be a man and he fell short, when I needed him to be my rock and he was wet toilet paper. Those are what helped me decide that this random day was the day I was going to pack up and leave him. I remembered the night out with my co-workers and how oppressed I felt at home. I remembered how he was contacting me so much during such a short period of time and demanding that I come home. I knew that this was the day I needed to leave.¬†


He went to take a shower strangely in the middle of the day and thought I knew for sure that his showers were so long, that I could leave without getting caught. I started packing my things, underwear and toiletries. He caught me red handed packing a box of my clothes. He had the shortest shower he has ever taken. He exploded when he had calculated that I was leaving him. He started shouting at me that I wasn't going to leave him. At one point he took my phone from me. I told him that if he didn't give me the phone that I have paid off back, I would scream at the top of my lungs HELP. He gave me my phone back. I told him that he had the chance to let me go like a grown adult or I would call the police if he kept threatening me and taking away my things. He started shouting at me, charging at me with each word. The spit was leaving his lips with each word he made. He started following me from room to room. Then he wouldn't let me pack my things. He cornered me. He blocked the door. I asked him to move and he left a small wedge of space for me to pass. I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. I called 911 as he was shouting and screaming through the door. He was calling me name after name and threatening me as I am speaking with the operator.¬†


When the officers arrived, he somehow made it seem like he was breaking up with me. He made me out to be the lunatic that couldn't handle being broken up with. I didn't care as long as I could get a few things and leave. No big deal. As I started packing my clothes, he was telling the officer that those were his clothes - bras, panties and women's floral shirts. Okay bud. I will leave it behind. Do you want my tampons and pantiliners too? I left it all behind. The officer said I could fight him in court over it. I took nothing but feminine products and my phone. He shut off my service to my phone before I even left the apartment. I couldn't call anyone to ask for help. I drove down to McDonald's and cried to the employee. I unloaded all of this baggage onto the sweetest employee ever. She sat with me for a bit, rubbed my back and gave me the store phone to call my mom and she called my uncle and aunt.


When my family arrived at the fast food restaurant, they called him and asked if they could come with me to get my things. He allowed them to come in. My mom lectured him about how women's panties, bras and tampons were not his and he knew it. When they all showed up with me, he called me all sorts of names. He spoke to me in such a vile tone and I knew that me leaving him that day, meant that I survived. He tried to get into my face and my mom stepped in. She said ""you better be so glad her dad isn't here to put you on your fucking ass for speaking to ANYONE like this. You will let her take her things and you won't speak to her ever again."" I have never been more proud of my mom then in that moment. We packed what we could, what he would let me take and we left.¬†


I moved in with my mom for a small amount of time. I rebuilt. I started from scratch. I started paying on a new bed frame, new mattress and new furniture. I got a text from him even though I blocked his number. He said ""nice new bed and mattress."" I said ""I haven't spoken to you since when I left in December, how do you know about my things?"" He said ""you know what I do for work."" Those words haunt me. At any moment in time, this psychopath could use his computer skills for evil and not good. He could track me down based off of my IP address. I saw him back trace an IP address when some random man was messaging me and kept getting new profiles. He was able to tell the man's very location and threaten him and turn the information into the police. It seems so silly that he would even spend time worrying about what I was up to when he was the one that ""left me"", remember? ü§£üòÇ


To this day, I carry pepper spray, I have taken self defense classes and I know my way around a firearm. I do not believe that a restraining order would protect me from a man like him. I do know that me leaving him, showed him that I am stronger than he ever knew. I will no longer be the type of woman that takes abuse. I pray that you are a much stronger woman than I ever was and will leave on the first red flag. Do not become immune to the abuse.¬†


I will teach my daughter about this man, if only to teach her to never change for anyone. I will teach her that despite all he did to knock me down, I got back up. I want to teach her to follow her gut to leave when a red flag shows itself. I survived. I came out feeling so depressed, suicidal and weak but in the end I met the man of my dreams and have 2 children. Despite all the evil words he said about me, I prove him wrong by living. I prove him wrong by being me. He couldn't put out my flame.¬†


You see, he might tell you about me, but I want you to know that I am here if you need me. I will be available to your calls, your messages or for advice. I am here despite all that I have been through to help you survive what I never thought was possible. When the first red flag pops up, I have been praying to God that you aren't like The Girl Before You.¬†",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Feeling awful for putting my husband in jail...,15,My husband has been abusive on and off for 2 years now.. I finally had enough and told a friend to call the police because my husband punched me in the car yesterday and pulled his knife out on me threatening to kill me.

I‚Äôm also just stressing out because he‚Äôs the provider. He will lose everything and my son and I will have no where to go and I‚Äôm also pregnant.

Adult child of co-dependent abusive parents and I don‚Äôt want to help them,2,"What a post for my first time posting on Reddit - I just don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm hoping you all might have some advice.

Background: as a child I witnessed many instances of my dad beating my mom, threatening to kill her, being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night because we were ‚Äúleaving‚Äù, but then standing at the door while my dad refused to let us leave. 

My grandparents lived right across the street from us and when they died their house was given to my parents. My grandfather built that house and my parents have ruined it by smoking and neglecting the upkeep.

Fast forward to now and I live two hours away from my parents, and my sister is four hours away. My parents are physically incapable of taking card of themselves, but refuse to move to assisted living or take any responsibility for getting someone to come in and help them. My sister and I have been begging them to do something for years. Tonight, my mom is sick and in the hospital and has asked me to drive two hours to their house to organize meds for my dad because he has no idea what he‚Äôs supposed to take and is apparently unable to read the labels. 

The thought of having to go and help him is quite literally making me sick. But the guilt of feeling like they are my parents is eating away at me. What do I do?",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

"As a man, I never thought I would be in this situation",17,"I‚Äôm a man, in my thirties. My wife is a few years older than me. Married over 7 years. My wife is very...particular and has high expectations. In some ways I welcomed it because I was not very motivated and kind of a slacker. I became cleaner, more organized. I wasn‚Äôt the best with personal finance so she asked to handle it and my credit score went through the roof. We‚Äôre very well off now thanks to her handling of our finances.

My wife hasn‚Äôt always been the nicest to me.When she‚Äôs stressed, she can actually be very mean to me. I‚Äôve been called names on numerous occasions like ‚Äúasshole, dumbfuck, lazy (despite working 50+ hours a week most of the time). She infers or threatens divorce, sometimes telling me that she‚Äôs going to take the house and our dogs. She is nicer to me more often than she is mean, but when she‚Äôs mean she‚Äôs really mean.

My wife is a control freak and can be mean, but honestly I was pretty happy for the first several years. When she‚Äôs not angry at me she treats me well. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company and she does nice things for me, like cooks and gives me thoughtful gifts. I do shift work and For the first 5 years of our marriage, we did not have a lot of time together. She worked a normal schedule and I worked nights and weekends. We made good use of the very little time we did have together and in the time we were apart, I stayed on top of my chores and responsibilities.

A few years ago, I started to talk to my wife about ambition to join the military. At first she was receptive, but then told me she would not do it, even for reserves. It crushed me. My wife has basically shot down just about every career change I have proposed because I really hate my job. It feels like she cares more about the money and security than my happiness.

When COVID hit, things got bad. Real bad. My wife has significant medical anxiety and it hit her hard. My wife was so worried about Covid, that she requested I isolate to a spare bedroom. When I would come home from work, I would have to wear a mask, throw my clothes directly into the washer, take a shower, and then isolate myself in the spare bedroom. She brought meals to me in the bedroom.

After a while she starting to ease up a little bit with Covid. There is a period where I had to wear a mask in the house but now we don‚Äôt. We both got vaccinated which I thought would change things but they haven‚Äôt. We still don‚Äôt go into other peoples houses or into stores without a mask. I haven‚Äôt been able to see my friends much at all because my wife is still so worried about catching the virus.

The increased time together was a huge adjustment. My wife now demands basically every moment of my attention now. We‚Äôre in this strange cycle where she wants me spend all of my time with her but then she‚Äôs mad that chores haven‚Äôt been done. If I do the chores, she‚Äôs mad at me for ‚Äúneglecting‚Äù her. If I don‚Äôt do my chores, I‚Äôm a lazy sack.

We started to have uglier and uglier fights. We started having fights that lasted all day. About once a week we have a knock out drag out fight that lasts all day. Sometimes multiple days. My job is very stressful and the added stress of this fighting has been terribly hard on me. I get so stressed out by these fights and the terrible things she says to me that I started just walking away from her. That sets her off. She says walking away means we‚Äôre getting divorce and that I need to stay and ‚Äúfix things‚Äù or ‚Äúfight it out‚Äù. I see no possibility for resolution in our fights. And they will go all night. I‚Äôve tried just going to bed. She‚Äôll turn the lights on, pull the blankets off me, even give me wet willeys to force me to get up to continue fighting with her.

As the fights continues to escalate over months, my desire to walk away to avoid confrontation increased. My wife insisted i had anger management issues and asked me to speak to a counselor. The counselor almost immediately requested her to join to do marriage counseling. That angered my wife and she told me to find a different counselor. That counselor did the same thing. The counselor told us that she needs to give me breaks during fights. My wife agreed to that, but she always comes up with exceptions or reasons to deny me a break. Or to cut my break short.

So when I would be denied a break, i would walk away. My wife began taking more and more measures to counter that. She started taking my car keys, my phone, and my wallet. She‚Äôll take them and hide them so I can‚Äôt leave. She would continue to badger me during the fights and when I would try to leave anyway, she would block me. After a while, things started getting physical. She started with shoves. I‚Äôd try to leave and she‚Äôd grab me or try to trip me. I ask her to not touch me and she does anyway. After a while I felt so powerless that I began to try to push past her to leave. She would escalate her response, physically block the doors. If I did make it to the car, she would hold the door open so I can drive away, or jump in the car.

I‚Äôve been a practitioner of martial arts for several years. I know joint locks, pressure points, strikes, etc. as she continued to escalate, I began resorting to joint locks to protect myself or facilitate my escape from the house. I have never hit her, just twisted her arm or wrist in a matter to keep her from grappling with me, hitting me, or blocking my escape. I‚Äôm much larger than her and I‚Äôm trained so i could easily actually hurt her, but i use the minimum amount of force necessary because I have no desire to hurt her. She has gotten some bruises as a result and has threatened to tell people I abuse her to cost me my job and damage my reputation. 

She recently broke my laptop by throwing it across the room at me. She broke a video game I borrowed from a friend. She hit me with a tray during a fight and throws my things.

I never told anyone about this until recently. About 2 years ago, a friend called me out of the blue to inform me he was getting a divorce and he told me he thinks I should do the same. He said he knew she was terrible to me. Recently I confided in the same friend about the entirety of the treatment. He has been insisting that I leave and get a divorce. He says I‚Äôm in abusive relationship and that I‚Äôm basically having stockhold syndrome or battered wife syndrome.

As I wrote this, it sounds horrible. My wife is also at times very loving, caring, generous, etc. it‚Äôs not all bad. It‚Äôs about 50/50. What should I do? Is this abuse? Should I leave? Are their organizations that can help me? I don‚Äôt even know how to access our bank accounts online.",TW Physical Violence
What to do,3,"I‚Äôm with a girl soon to be 21 years old, we have an 11 month baby. She has a temper that is easily triggered. I just bought us a home and we have been here a couple of weeks. 

Tonight at 3am she woke me up because the baby wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. I went to help, picked up the baby and was following her to the bedroom. She stopped in the middle of the living room due to a projector on the ground. I was walking close behind her so i ran into her and put my hand out to avoid squishing the crying baby.

She turns around and punches and kicks me. I ignore it thinking she‚Äôs just tired. But she becomes enraged and keeps on so i push her to protect the baby that I‚Äôm still holding. She goes and grabs a chair and throws it at me even tho I‚Äôm holding the baby. I block most of it with a door but still gets my arm and gives me a huge scratch the length of my arm. Her sister wakes up and comes out from a bedroom. 

The sister watched as she trashed the kitchen in a rage. She then picks up 2 plates and throws them at me, even tho I‚Äôm just watching her from a great distance, even tho I‚Äôm holding the baby. She then demands to get the baby and i say no because she‚Äôs in a rage. She then goes to unplug my bedroom Nest camera because she knows its always recording. I put the baby down to plug it back in and she grabs the baby and goes into the master bedroom with her sister.

Im afraid to call the cops because she‚Äôs been taking a real estate course and a record would prevent her from getting her license.

My mind says the right thing to do would be to have her out. I don‚Äôt want our child growing in this environment but I‚Äôm afraid of what she will do to the baby if she‚Äôs alone with her because of her rage. Im constantly asking her to Pickup things she can choke on and saying things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt leave the outlets exposed use the covers‚Äù so I‚Äôm afraid for her safety if we split.

I‚Äôm really at a lost of words right now. I have no one to turn too. No family, no friends. My husband of three years significant other of 12 years this June hit me last night causing my eye to show a red dot, bruise on my arm.. bald spots from hair being pulled. I hit him in the mouth to stop him from continually hitting me and busted his bottom lip on the inside but he kept slapping my phone out of my hand and hit my jaw where I passed out at the wheel almost while on the street leaving. I can‚Äôt believe I hit him back... I feel like a pos. He then Bent my fender in on my car. Well he is now today claiming I am the mental one (all started from me hugging a gay guy friend which I wouldn‚Äôt particularly be happy if he hugged a gay girl friend in front of me)  and he is done with the marriage wants to be roommates until we figure out house and cars in our name. I truly love this man so much I begged him this morning not to leave me. I have no idea how to feel or what to do. I‚Äôm so hurt right now... I even start a new job title Monday and now my eye and the way things are I just want to run away... disappear from everything. I feel so alone. We went to his family‚Äôs house, he pulling the steering wheel to take the exit off the highway, while the fight occurred after been downtown drinking. They all laughed with him and acted as if everything was going to be fine. His dad even stood up to me when I walked up to him to tell him he was wrong for hitting me...  he smiled in my face and made me feel so little. He was drunk at this point too. I don‚Äôt know what will happen from here. If he changes his mind, which he delete me and my family off Facebook then blocked me. He‚Äôs now on his computer talking to his friend while I‚Äôm left in the bedroom thinking... what if that never happened? Should I be happy it did? Will he change his mind and want to continue the marriage? Do I find a divorce lawyer and go through with it anyway? We have a house two cars credit cards in our names which can get figured out but we have two bull terriers that I‚Äôd hate to separate. I‚Äôm so fucking lost... i even thought about taking my life last night. Just leaving him at his family‚Äôs and crashing myself into a ditch. Hoping I‚Äôd roll over and no longer feel anything.

Overseas friend calling cops on ex in Washington,2,"My friend overseas is thinking about calling the cops to hopefully get a protection order against her partner that she lives with. She has recordings of him admitting that he violently raped her when she was young (she was 15, he was 17-18) a picture from that day as well of marks on her neck. She also has recent recordings of his emotional manipulation along with an audio recording of him admitting he grabbed her phone and through it at her in rage ""hit me back and make it even why don't you"". There's another recording of him also admitting to turning the Wifi off so she can't communicate to me (the mobile 4g is pretty clippy) and also admitting that he turned off the power so we can't video call or charge her phone I assume (this happened many times to isolate her from me). They are in seperate rooms due to the cats not allowing them to be together. She has tried breaking up with him many times but he breaks her down emotionally to the point where ""she feels she has to calm him down sexually"". The past couple days she's finally taken a stand and approached to calm him down but midway through an act she stopped, froze. He then screamed at her face, pushed her off the bed and grabbed her legs and her held her in wheelbarrow for a bit. I've become her trust in the process and helped her understand that none of this is her fault, she had an argument with him where he seemingly agreed to for them to just ignore eachother in the apartment. However, he has started turning up the heat in the main room in order to ""sweat her out"" as he knows she can't handle the heat like he can. Despite telling him to turn it down, he still went out again to turn it up. I have a feeling he will escalate things again because thats what predators do especially since he's addicted to dabs (she's sober btw, does nothing regularly not even coffee). If she were to call the cops would all this evidence she has be enough to get a protection order against him? also would it help if I was a witness over the phone when they arrive to backup her testimony. I am however in Australia. Also if she were to get a protection order, would she have to pursue it? because all she wants rn is the safety to pack her things and move which is pretty much impossible with him in the apartment.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
"My mum is emotionally, verbally and at times physically abusive to my dad. I understand she has had some issues in the past, and it seems incredibly hard for her to move forward. What should a 17 year old living with their parents do?",9,"Hi,

the abuse can go on for 5‚Äì7+ for hours on end each day like crazy for a week, but there can be months without it. My mum has been diagnosed with PTSD but the infromation she shared with her therapist was very biased and she unfortunately exaggeratted many of her incidents (which she has exaggerated in her mind unfortunately)

Many of her problems with her past arise from a lack of assertiveness and her avoiding smaller conflicts in familial relationships in the extended family which has led to the current, longer and complicated conflicts, a result of her regrets and issues boiling under the rug for many years.

If the genders were reversed, this would most certainly be considered verbal abuse stemming from a lack of responsibility in the past. Unfortunately, these issues have led to my mum retreating from society, with little social life and little physical exercise, which in my experience are paramount to good mental health. Consequently, she has become more afraid and anxious then ever and financially dependant on my dad, without a job. I really feel for her, she is trying to fix these issues but her mental patterns seem to be a large obstruction. Her mental state is so corrupted, all she can do is yell for at times entirely 8 hours straight, just pure angry and she seems to enjoy it. I am genuinly scared that she might severly injure my father in this and have cried a couple of times‚Ä¶

Whenever we try to discuss a possible solution such as separation which would involve financial independence, she just goes on a rant of exaggerated events in the extended family that happened maybe twice in her life(akin to jokes your friends might make) as the sole reason as to why she has no self-confidence and no concentration to study. Though this is certainly true, her and I both know that is the solution, yet she is unwilling to put the effort in. She insists on preparing every single meals for us and cooking too much snacks for us which occupy her time immensely. I feel for her, the regret and dwelling on the past which causes inaction which causes more regret the day after. It has certainly worsened the situation. My sister and I have decided to make more meals ourselves and do more chores so she has more time to herself.

On the other hand, my dad‚Äôs genuine attempts to help her are shut down by mum, as she thinks they are ‚Äúa way too make himself seem better‚Äù. My dad seems to be a trigger point of the previous conflicts she has had with the family members of my father, some of whom are now deceased. She does not want to take any assistance from him and feels guilty spending ‚Äúhis money‚Äù, however my dad has convinced her to pursue an education to help her become financially independent and separate if she desires to do so. The abuse, the shouting he gets in return is absolutely horrendous, she abuses him for what people related to him did to her 10 years ago at 7 in the morning and belittles him for every little thing. In this rage, she can‚Äôt think clearly and it just worsens and is unable to hold logical discussions and finds obscure tangents so she can continue her rant. She controls my dad and says doesn't want to see her face but doesn't let him leave the house either. 

I pray to God my mum becomes courageous, becomes independent and has a stable mental health. And that my father is also able to live in a safe and peaceful household.

I also have a younger sister (14), though quite mature, but i am concerned for her future mental health.

Were my parents being abusive toward each other? (TW: Probably Violence?),3,"TW: Physical and Emotional Violence? (Unsure if it counts, but just in case)

First of all, I wanted to make clear that English is not my first language, so sorry if there's any grammar mistake.

Now, some information: I'm 17 y/o and my parents are already divorced years from now (Not legally because other issues, but they're no longer in a relationship) and since a couple of days I've been questioning my self if their relationship was abusive. My memories are kinda blurry but after years from the events something doesn't feel right.

My parents were the type that fights a lot. My memories are plagged with their discussions and for me was (and still is) the principal characteristic of their relationship. At the beginning I thought it was normal, like ""every couple fights"" but now I think there were things that can be considered abuse:

1.- My dad blamed everything on my mom. All his failures, his reactions, his behavior, everything was my mom's fault. Never took responsibility of his actions.

If he was like he was it was because some mistake my mom did (E: He blamed on her that he had to work long hours because she didn't had a job and was a housewife, we'll get into that later)


2.- He called her names. In almost every fight I remember him calling my mom ""a little sick"", crazy, and basically downplaying her with that.


3.- They hurted each other physically a couple of times. My mom kicked my dad once, and he grabbed her by the arm to the point of leaving bruises like twice (That I know)


4.- My dad threatened to call the police. My dad, after the kick, called the police (as he warned a couple of times) and we were all night at police station. For some reason finally nothing happened and we went back home. 

After that, my dad used that threat and that it wouldn't be ""that easy next time"" with the police in arguments. 


5.- He always minimized her bc she didn't finish her career. I was born in their university years, and even though my mom made it until her last year, she didn't finish. My dad almost every fight remind her that, used the ""I'm the breadwinner"" card just because she didn't had a job, and basically said that was the cause of all their problems.

My mom after some years wanted to retake her career or find a job, but my dad wasn't very helpful and didn't really supported her, so she ended up confined to the housework and childcare.

Even if that wasn't his intention, that affected my mom social life and she didn't really have many friends (plus, we were living in a city almost 3 hours away of their hometown, so no direct family/best friends for her).


6.- My mom also insulted him, but I don't remember any particular insult o name that was repetitive more than he wasn't really collaborative or he was selfish.

Finally, some facts that may be useful 

-When my mom fist told my dad he was pregnant he accused her of cheating and even called her a slut (But she justified him with ""He was young and scared)

-My dad's childhood was kinda messy (Parents also divorced)

-My dad prioritized his job and kinda himself over us. When I was little broke a lot of promises of visiting me (we didn't live together) and even under the same roof ignored us/left us aside bc he was focusing in his thesis and other projects.

-He left my mom on the middle of her retaking university (And little later he had already a new partner)


And I guess that is, or at least what I remember. Sorry if it's too long but I wanted to make things clear and I really need to know the real weight of the situation for my and my mom's inner peace (Also, I think she isn't really over it and I need more basis to her going back to therapy).

He's told me he's going to kill me. Or rather he's really angry that he's going to end up in prison for killing me. I know I need to leave. 

But I'm scared. I have no one in my life that understands what's going on, I don't even understand myself. 2 weeks ago I was still under his spell and then I just snapped, like a bubble bursting, all of a sudden I could see again.

Recently i had a dream where he was playing some games with me doing our usual thing with me and my sister and they would start having sex next to me. And back when me and him were together him having sex with another woman and telling me about it or me finding out about it always makes me feel insecure and upset and pissed off. I was pissed off so much that i left the room and tried to lock myself in the bathroom only for him to hit down the door and then proceeded to choke me out and abused me the same way he used to.

Hearing was today,4,"I'm stressed out and a whole bag of emotions here. Not necessarily a question per se. It's been a long road with a long road ahead too. Almost 7 months ago my wife was arrested when she had mental issues and attacked me with a knife. Best I can tell she took some drug she thought was something else, combined with lack of sleep. Now I'm in a bizarre situation where she has a peaceful contact order on her, but I've moved out to rent a room so she and our child can be at home while I go to work (she's disabled and has minimal income). We are far from the typical DV case. Anyway today I was subpoenaed to testify as witness/victim. Nobody else witnessed it. But it was very stressful and confusing. I wear hearing aids and had to ask people multiple times to speak up. Both the DA/prosecution attorney and the defense/private attorney I had spoken to. I was under the impression I could choose not to testify and that is protected for DV cases. But the judge started saying something about the law changing. Something about being in contempt and a fine. Her microphone was too far away and everyone wears masks so I can't lip read and it's hard to hear what's being said. And the DA attorney comes over and he's says something and I don't understand and he gave me a choice like A B or C and I chose the one about letting the police enter my testimony. But then that's not what I really wanted so I ended up having to charge up to the microphone podium and tell the judge I can't hear and don't understand and she moved the mic closer finally. But I was so stressed out it didn't make sense and she asked me something and I answered. Then she said I could go and I was so stressed out I just basically ran away. I ran down the stairs and some guy was behind me and said something but I was too stressed out. I went down flights of stairs and out a door and it set off a fire alarm. And then I'm out in some no-mans-land alleyway with garbage bins behind the jail and the courthouse. It was so stressful and confusing. I just want to go home and be able to tuck my kid into bed and be with my family. I was told by my wife that the cops testified after I left and were rude as well. And that this will take 6 more months and I can't imagine it. I hope they just offer a deal. I'll pay them whatever they want at this point. I just want to go home.

Abusive Ex is making threats to beat up my new boyfriend,4,"So, my ex has an open court case and pending trial for attacking and trying to kill me. He recently called an old mutual friend and asked them if I can grant him permission to see his kids even if it's supervised visits (there is currently a restraining order on him for 1 year). In the same breathe, he threatened my new boyfriend and said that he is still going to beat him up if he sees him. 

I'm so frustrated because I just want to live my life and I don't want him sabotaging my relationships and making my life more difficult than it has to be. I currently have No Contact with my abuser, and plan on keeping it that way forever if I had my way. I don't want him to see our kids because he just isn't stable mentally to do so and will probably use them to get to me. My kids don't even want to see him out of fear that he will hurt me. I guess hearing that he is making threats and requesting to see the kids has brought back my fears and anxiety that I've worked so hard to get over. 

I want to believe that I have nothing to worry about.. keep living my life, and move on happily but I feel like he is a dark cloud that will never go away.

"Abusive (ex) boyfriend is a local ""Legend""",27,"Almost a month ago now I called the police on my boyfriend for slapping me hard in the face. I was lucky he didn't hit my ear and I still have my hearing. The abuse, mentally, verbal, emotional, and physical began years ago and within the last maybe 6 months I really thought he was going to kill me one day. Although looking back he really could have killed me at any point. But I felt immobilized, like a zombie. 

Fast forward a week ago and he texts at me 1:30am probably drunk . We're supposed to be no contact per police orders. In  his text he apologizes, thanks me for calling the police and setting him straight. Promises never to hit a woman again. I tell him he's entitled that he can even obey a police order and if he contacts me again I'll report him.

In our town he's a local ""legend"" everyone knows him and tell him how much of a badass he is. He's well known and loved by many. I feel so frustrated because of how all these people adore him while I've been quietly suffering for years now. I want to share my story, but also am not ready to. So everyone can hate me and side with him? Judge me and disregard my experience because I'm a nobody compared to him? Or if he lies to people that I was abusive?

I thought he was simply buzzed and not acting his normal self at first when he told me he loved me and wanted to marry me. But it just got worse and worse.  He told me he wants me to move away with him, that he is moving in with me, told me he loved me over and over. He wants kids with me. I am ""perfect"". That he will always be in my life. That I cant have sex with anybody else. Then he added some emotional/sexual and physical assault to the mix. By that time I had picked up on the fact that has at least 4 different personalities, it was one of the most terrifying things Ive ever witnessed. Dont know if he is completely insane (but apparently they put him in some psych ward during one of his many prison stays) or if he used/uses too many hard drugs. To top it off he filled me in on his extensive and very brutal and  scary criminal trackrecord as he was refusing to let me go home.

This is the 3rd time some dangerous nutcase has decided I am the love of their life. It went very,very badly the first 2 times, that type is extremly ruthless and dangerous. I dont want to deal with this crap anymore.

I know what to do legally/safety planning wise. But I was hoping that maybe somebody has some advice for me on how to convince this latest maniac and all of his other personalities that he does not like me,that he doesnt want me and to forget about me?

I [19F] am unsure if my relationship with my boyfriend [22] is abusive and if I should leave,13,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for on here exactly, whether that be advice or someone telling me what they think of the situation. But here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on with me in the past year. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of one year over something really stupid. We were living together (I‚Äôm 19, he is 22), and I wanted to move out because I felt like I needed to spend some more time alone, to try to see if I can focus on myself a little more. He got very angry with me for this, and eventually he broke up with me. I wanted to handle it very maturely. I let him know that I loved him very much, that I was still there for him if he ever needed me. But he then bullied me. He told me he slept with another girl the day before one of our first dates (that gave me the worst UTI ever lol). He told me how stupid I was, that i was fat, had a flat ass, poor comprehension, couldn‚Äôt speak properly, was ugly... list goes on and on. He basically hit every insecurity I had, and I had a pretty bad mental break down. I should also mention that there were times where he has hit me for waking him up and tickling him (when I was tickling him he seemed to have a good time and then all of the sudden hed punch me in the arm to the point where I had a huge bruise).  He threatened to give my stuff away or throw it out. The next day I came rushing to get my stuff because of that, and he acted very sly as if he did nothing wrong and laughed at me. I slapped him and I immediately felt very bad and I cried and hugged him. He then said sorry, that he deserved that slap and said everything will be okay. The next day I woke up to friends texting me screenshots of an Instagram post. he had hacked into my account and then posted a video recording of me slapping him and said ‚Äústopped by my ex‚Äôs house yesterday morning to get my stuff. He cried only after a couple of hits (I slapped him once). Still went on about how he wished we worked out... I calmed down later so easy on the hate guys.‚Äù This sent me down another spiral!

Few months later, I went to a party and he was threatening to kill himself. I was fucking worried and I Ubered there.i was drunk and under the impression that we would just talk, but he set up an elaborate date. He later coerced me that night. All I remember was saying that I just wanted to cuddle, I said no many times but he proceeded to stick it in anyways. Few says later I told him that made me uncomfortable. But he totally gaslighted me and said that never happened. Then said I was accusing him of rape! But all I said was that I was uncomfortable with what happened. 

Then I started to see another guy . We slept with each other. But we later agreed to stay friends. Months later I got back together with my ex and then he found out two weeks later. And this is where it starts getting really bad! He forced me to leave that guy, even though I cared about him a lot and wanted him to be a lifelong friend. And then I started to mess up badly. I proceeded to hang out with him and lied to my boyfriend. Then boyfriend continues to hack my email, even tried to turn my location on to see where I was at all times! Even hacked my friend too and got all of his personal information down, including his parents‚Äô. 

I then cheated on my boyfriend and today he found out by hijacking my phone. Of course I felt guilty of it then but I do so now as well. I can‚Äôt but feel I‚Äôm still at fault for all of this. And I don‚Äôt know why I ever returned to him and still feel like I want to be with him. I feel so terrible. What do I do? How do I make up for this? I feel like a terrible person.

Scared and need help.,37,"I never thought I would be writing this but my boyfriend of 4 years physically abused me last night. We have had a rocky, on and off relationship over the years but he has NEVER laid a finger on me and I never expected him to. But he did.
&nbsp; 

So we recently had a disagreement (not physical) about how I find it really annoying when he calls me multiple times if I don't answer. Not like, back to back or anything, but this all came to a head the other day because I was trying to take a nap and he called me twice in an hour. I told him if I don't answer I'm either sleeping or working (I'm freelancing right now so I work at random hours from home.) He agreed that he would not do this anymore and apologized.

&nbsp;¬†

Last night, I was working on my computer and he kept calling me. I ignored him and kept sending him to voicemail, thinking I would call him when I was done. Then I read his texts and he said he was on his way over to get something he left in my room. So I tried to just hand it to him and tell him to leave. He tried to start an argument and I said ""I'm really upset and I don't want to talk. Please just leave."" Around this time I noticed he REEKED of alcohol. He doesn't drink often anymore but when he does he is a total asshole - but it's always been verbal fights.



&nbsp;¬†

I was sitting on the bed and he was standing next to me. Again, in 4 years, he has never even shoved me. I grew up with an extremely abusive stepdad who beat my mom and me, and I also had a guy I briefly dated in my early 20s who hit me once and I immediately broke up with him. So I'm very familiar with domestic abuse and I never saw any sign of it.


&nbsp;¬†

All of a sudden, I was on the ground, and his hand was on my throat. I was shocked more than anything. He had yanked me off the bed by my arm and I have a huge bruise where he grabbed me. I just could not believe he did that to me. He let me up and I was terrified. I was looking around for a weapon and grabbed kitchen scissors to try to keep him away from me. He grabbed me and wrestled them out of my hand. I kept telling him to get out and he wouldn't leave. He kept saying ""Answer the phone when I call you"" and I said ""You will never call me ever again because I'm blocking you now and don't want to ever see you again.""

&nbsp;¬†

So he still wouldn't leave and I started recording him talking for evidence. First he tried to say that he didn't do anything until I got the scissors and he was defending himself. Then I finally got him to admit what he did. I have about 30 min of recorded conversation where he repeatedly admits to everything, and I  also have photos of the bruise and the scratches on my arms. I have them uploaded to multiple cloud storages.


&nbsp;¬†

I finally got him out, and I had immediately blocked his number, but I can still see when he calls in my call list. I finally called him and said ""I don't know if you understand that you're blocked?"" and it turned into him crying and saying he's making a therapy appointment on Monday.

&nbsp;¬†

I would love to just be rid of him forever, but here's the problem - I'm kind of dependent on him right now. He helps me a lot financially. And I'm in a really bad living situation right now that I can't get out of on my own, and he is supposed to pay for first last and security and cosign on an apartment for me. I also have a storage unit in default that we were supposed to clear out today, we had a truck and a new unit reserved and everything but I couldnt be around him right now. I honestly don't know how I'm going to get out of this otherwise and I'm probably going to end up homeless. I don't have family who can help, or anyone else in my life.

&nbsp;¬†

I know this is like such a typical abuser pattern to commit violence and then apologize, but I do feel like since he never did anything like this in over 4 years, even though we've had some crazy arguments - maybe I could possibly be safe to get out of my living situation before I cut him off? I definitely want to end this, I don't want to end up like my mom with a man beating on me, but I also don't want to be homeless or in the situation I'm currently in. I was thinking maybe I can just make sure to never be alone with him again and try to get this all done in the next couple of weeks? He also knows I have the recordings and I told him if he fucked with me I would send them to everyone in his life. Am I being stupid right now? Should I just cut it off now and whatever happens happens?

&nbsp;¬†

Also just a note - I'm very anti cop and I don't want anything to do with police or courts. I would honestly feel less safe with cops than with him. I also really don't want to go to a DV shelter, or any kind of shelter

Feeling trapped,4,"I don‚Äôt know where else to turn at this point. Backstory: my (20F) 16 year old brother has been abusing me physically for about 8 years or so. You may ask how that is possible. He has always been very strong and very violent. He has major uncontrollable rage and anger issues. My mother who we live with will not get him help. He is on medication but will rarely take it. He is not in therapy. There is nothing. He has bad OCD and my family uses it as justification for the abuse and him being out of control. Lately my mother has also gotten in on the emotional abuse he also inflicts on me daily. They will both scream and yell at me for the littlest things. I used to call the police many years ago, but because we were both minors, and my mothers persuasion, it was always brushed off as a simple sibling spat. So I stopped calling because my mother would be very very angry when I called because she doesn‚Äôt want other people to know what is going on. The last time he beat me extremely bad, other than his usual smaller attacks, my mother threatened to kick me out if I called the police. He has threatened countless times and actually attempted to kill me multiple times. 

Now for what happened a few days ago. 

My mother and brother were yelling at me for doing something small that upset my brother. And he picked up my dog, I begged him not to hurt the dog. He is my baby and the only one on this house who won‚Äôt hurt me. He said he wouldn‚Äôt and I thought he just did it to taunt me. We kept arguing and then he got even angrier and THREW MY DOG ACROSS THE ROOM AS HARD AS HE COULD. My mother was not angry at him. We took my dog to the emergency vet hospital and luckily he is okay. But I cannot continue to live in these circumstances anymore. But I do not have the resources to leave. I can‚Äôt drive and do not have a car, my job is near my house. I don‚Äôt have the money to live on my own. And I am afraid I can‚Äôt take my dog with me, who I fear will be my brothers next target. 

There is obviously a lot more to this but that‚Äôs the main parts. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I desperately want to file a police report, but am afraid my mother will kick me out, so I need to find another place to live first. I am scared every second that I am here.

This morning I wanted to wear a skirt, the prettiest one in my closet. It's sunny outside and I wanted to feel cute (for myself!). I've always loved wearing skirts, dresses, shorts, etc, I feel pretty in it.

Right after I took it, my boyfriend told me ""you're not gonna wear this"" ""you ain't dressing like a sl*t"", ""the other guys will look at you, don't make me start a fight"" I obviously told him that I dress the way I want and that it's not 1920 anymore. He started becoming aggressive and he raised his voice. And then he  took pants out of my closet and made me wear it (he took my legs by force and basically dressed me up). Then he hid all of my skirts.

I took off the pants right after and while he believed that he won, I secretly put another skirt that I left in the bathroom. When he saw me in it, he took off my skirt by force, I screamed at him and told him to leave me alone, but he didn't stop. That skirt was tight so my panties went off as well. I don't know why but I felt so ashamed and violated. It's weird because I know that he didn't do it to see my private parts and has seen me naked before, but it was really different this time. I felt... humiliated. 

I didn't want it to happen again so I'm wearing pants. He won.",TW Physical Violence
A long distance relationship turned into a nightmare,3,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm writing this in tears and I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk about it. 

We have been in a long distance relationship for 3 years. 6 months ago he (25 years old) decided to move from NYC to Brazil to live with me (29 years old).

We had some arguments during quarantine but today everything got worse. 

In the morning, I complained about the lack of attention, sometimes he doesn‚Äôt want to get intimate. He doesn‚Äôt want to be touched or kissed. He doesn‚Äôt even want to have sex. He complains a lot about how my body looks too. He didn‚Äôt agree. He said he always gives me attention and all of that.

After this conversation, he said he wanted to go back to his town because all I do is complaining for no reason. Then, we broke up.

He was packing and started smoking, I told him not to smoke inside of my house. And he said he didn‚Äôt care. After this, he started to get physical, he choked and pulled me against the wall. I threw his keys away and he dropped me on the floor and started choking me again.

I was speechless. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or how to react. He said it was my fault because I teased him. Afterwards he apologized for everything.

He is addicted to Marijuana and LSD. It‚Äôs not the first time he was physical. 

I can‚Äôt see my life without him. I feel like I will never love you someone or be loved again. 

Any advices?

Thanks y‚Äôall",TW Physical Violence
Boyfriend escalating violence?,4,"My first warning sign was one day when he got really angry about money and smashed his laptop, breaking it.

Then a different argument/day he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù threw his keys at me. It left a bruise and an outline of the keys. The latest to happen is, today I accidentally broke the blinds (that were already somewhat broken) after he told me to stop fidgeting with them and he shoved me. He says I disrespected him by not listening to him when he said to stop and does not feel remorseful about shoving me. I don‚Äôt even remember what he got angry about all the other times.

Can‚Äôt get the courage to press charges,6,"TW: physical abuse, sexual assault 

I‚Äôm so conflicted and confused by everything I know my husband won‚Äôt get better unless I press charges and even then he might not, and I need to protect my child from him. But I just keep holding on to this feeling that he can get better I just need to give him one last chance.

He is a narcissist, he hit me in the face and caused me to bleed and he said I did it to myself. He coerced me into a 4 way by getting me drunk and doing it when I was most vulnerable. But it wasn‚Äôt sexual assault because I benefited more than he did. It‚Äôs not cheating because it‚Äôs not like he hooked up with anyone. 

I‚Äôm so tired of the lies and the back and forth and I just want closure or to wake up and for it to be a fever dream and he‚Äôs the person who I remember him being at first. Which I know was an act he love bombed me and he made me feel so good then took it all away. I just want to wake up and for him to be a father and a good husband. I want him to be the image he showed me he was. 

If I report him and charges are filed I lose him possibly forever but he might be shocked into being better and getting better, with some of the programs available they will drop the charges if he makes the effort to better himself. If I do nothing he can keep abusing my trust and hurt our child. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

What should I do?,6,"TRIGGER WARNING 

Earlier today I (26f) was doing the dishes & asked my gf(30f) to bring me in the dishes from the living room. She replied with ‚Äúare you serious? You‚Äôre already up‚Äù while she was playing call of duty. I responded with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a loser‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt respond lightly, jumped up and said she wanted me to take her to her house, gathered her things & waiting outside. I had to clean the house up quickly before leaving (we stayed at my moms after finding out that my dad was in the hospital). Whenever I got into the car she was screaming in my face about how I called her a loser and didn‚Äôt apologize and it‚Äôs my fault that she is feeling this way right now so now I have to face the consequences. She started beating into my dash board, threw out my Bluetooth transmitter, attempted to crush an old cassette tape, all while screaming at me as I drove her 1.5 miles to her house. I asked her to get out of the car at one point after she threw out my Bluetooth transmitter. She has a history of wrecking my car. We were at a stop light when as soon as we pulled away she punched my windshield and smashed it it along with my rear view mirror. That‚Äôs when I got involved and hit her in her face. She was pissed off and I was swerving all over. I never ‚Äúwant‚Äù to hit her. It‚Äôs more of something I‚Äôve had to do to stand my ground even tho hitting is completely unacceptable. I always feel like complete shit after. Alas this is not the only time she has done this while driving in my car. I don‚Äôt even get into her car cus she has no problem driving fast to scare me and slam in her brakes. Anyways. I hit her and then she eventually punched my windshield again and then again so there are 3 ‚Äúfire works‚Äù in my windshield. I tried to hit her again but I missed, so I grabbed her hair and put her head down in order for her to stop completely destroying my cAr so we could get her to her house as fast as possible without smashing into someone else going the opposite direction. She stopped messing with my stuff after I let go until we got to her house where she spit in my face twice & then took me by the head and punched my twice & grabbed my glasses acting like she was going to break them. I am blind as a bat and wouldn‚Äôt have been able to drive without them. She eventually gave them back and the grabbed the shifter thing and tried ripping it out and ripping out my blinker handle thing. I tried calling the cops until I realized that I hit her. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do. I don‚Äôt know if I should do anything. I have her blocked in everything. Do I file a report for her to pay for my windshield and then get a protective order? Or do I just count my loss and leave it alone. I am not in a position to repair anything as I don‚Äôt feel there is a reason to go back. My father is dying of cancer & in the hospital w pneumonia and she acts like it‚Äôs nothing. There is a lack of care on her end. I am not justifying what I did or said to her.

Having him arrested was the HARDEST thing ever,4,"After many years of friendship we started a relationship. It just kind of happened, terrible timing too. I was moving 1200 miles away. He was supposed to come with me but didn't right away. A month later he joins me and immediately turns into Mr. Hyde. Less than 48 hours later he is arrested for aggravated harassment and I have been an absolute wreck since. I spent a week crying my eyes out, absolutely devastated that he turned into that person. All I wanted was the chance to finally be happy and I thought he was that happiness finally. Far from it. I finally woke up angry on day 8 which was also his birthday unfortunately I guess. I decided to allow him to call me through a friend and lost my shit when he said ""You said you loved me then you put me in jail""  You're damn right I did. I feared for my life as you threatened to take it multiple times. He hung up on me.  Today as I was leaving work, I had decided that I was going to visit him. Why? I have no idea. (Victims guilt? Is that a thing?) I had/have no idea what thought could possibly be accomplished besides another emotionally draining day. I even let the thought enter my head that now that he is getting mental help while in there (he had a psychotic break causing all if this) that maybe things could still work as long as he promised to continue to get help via inpatient stay. I also knew JUST how dumb this thought was and still rolled it around with conviction. Well, when I got home I checked my mail, and it made that decision for me. My protective order was in the mail. Thank you sweet baby Jesus for that ENORMOUS sign that I was being an idiot. I will admit that I do ""feel bad"" in a way because a person cant help it when mental illness rears itself especially im such a nasty and scary way, but I went ahead and put some money on his books so he can get some essentials.

I might leave my abusive h/b this year. How much info do I share with our young teenage daughter....,7,"My daughter has been privy to her Dad's angry outbursts for the entirety of her life. She's tearfully pleaded with me to leave him for over a year. 
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Should I tell her any of my plans?‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 

The dv group I'm working with hasn't been very helpful... they don't have resources set up (generally speaking) for disabled  mothers. In my state, help is available based on which county one resides. A group member recently told me that I might not be able to leave my bully..er.. husband because of my poor health. That was tough,  because I was told for several years this group would help me when I was ready to leave. 

I've had 3surgeries b/c of my husband. He made me feel like a burden and feel guilty for my health issues. I spent days in bed with 1 migraine in order to avoid costly ED visits. I walked on a broken foot for years because the only treatment was surgery and my husband felt he was toov good to find job that offered best coverage. My poor daughter has seen it all. Medical, financial, verbal,  emotional abuses. She doesn't remember t the physical abuse, because I stupidly told my husband if he kept leaving marks on my body,people would know what he was doing to me. 

Anyone wondering why I haven't left after 15yrs? It's because I'm a physically disabled mother. There's no program in my state that helps people like me leave dv situations. How do we leave? Where would we go? I can't afford anything in a safe neighborhood without completely draining my savings, b/c real estate is crazy expensive.


I love my husband but he has caused me and our daughter so much pain,  suffering. My heart breaks for what my daughter is going through. 

Wondering why my family doesn't help? Oh, they do....they pray for us. That's all the help I need according to them. Meanwhile, my parents and extended family give my dual addiction... er, dual diagnosis sister most anything she asks for. Cash? Ok. Pay bills? Sure. She made bad choices that led her to the place she is now.

My boyfriend or probably now ex was an ex junkie and was in recovery for some time, and had a successful year with me. Due to Covid and car problems and family issues he endured he relapsed because of suicidal tendencies and what not. Over the last year and a half I‚Äôve been going through physical and mental abuse. My credit is down the drain I currently am living with my mother where we both were in the living room after he got us kicked out from his family‚Äôs home where we had a small place. 
He would blow up, drive away etc using my car that‚Äôs under my name. 
We have found spoons and baggies which he claims were old yet just now I found more spoons. 
Anyways it‚Äôs been just too much to even list what he‚Äôs done to me, but today he got mad that my mother found another spoon(which honestly he was eating pudding and left it somewhere because I watched him), and started to go off at me because of it. I tried to calm him down and explained if he‚Äôs not calm enough he won‚Äôt be able to keep the car because the roomates wanted him out by the end of this week and I wanted to help him find somewhere to stay. This morning I hid the key and told him good luck on going to work because I hid it cause I feared he wouldn‚Äôt come back with it. He threatened to Hotwire the car in which I said no, got into a heated argument and I hit him because he kept yelling every name in the book at me. In which he threw me across everywhere and whatnot I ignored it and ran to the car to prevent him from taking it. He pulled me by the hair and threw me on the side walked punched and kicked me which the neighbor got on her door bell ring video. 
Cops come I explained what happened and thankfully since he assaulted me they could look for him to find the car too. 
He calls me from a random number as I was still talking to the cops and I convinced him to come back while they were on standby. He‚Äôs bipolar so he came back calmer and I just felt so bad I had to call the cops and say he was here. 
He yelled that I ruined his life and he hopes I die etc. 
I‚Äôm debating on bailing him out but I know that would be just as dumb. 
He had so much potential and I don‚Äôt want to ruin his life and want him to succeed in life but it wasn‚Äôt working out at all.

I've been recommended to post here,11,"I posted this on r/relationships and it was removed and said it was better suited to here. To be clear, I don't think I'm a victim of domestic violence but I really need help and don't know where to go. I guess I am starting to get quite scared of him though.

How can I (29f) help my husband (32m) through this rough patch and also keep my own sanity? And how can I hide this from my kids (6f 2f and 2month old f) 

My husband (32m) has been struggling with his mental health for almost a year now. He has been to see a doctor and has been put on some strong anti anxiety and anti depressants. We currently can not see a therapist because of money reasons. 

He has been taking money from our credit card (I don't have access to see our credit card statements) for months without me realizing and spending it on crypto currency and then pretty much losing it. He has taken about $5k in the last month and has nothing to show for it.  We are struggling with money right now and I don't understand why he keeps doing this. I snooped though his phone to find his out because he want telling me why our credit card payments have been so high recently. He keeps saying that he knows what he is doing and his is how we are going to free ourselves of money problems. 
I guess I do believe him that he knows what he is doing and that he's just having a bad couple of months but it's really hard to be supportive when I don't have enough money to feed our family and he keeps lying to me about where our money goes.

The biggest thing though is his anger. He is starting to get really angry at me especially. Nothing physical, although he did get a bit physical while I was pregnant with my middle child but that hasn't happend since.
He's starting yelling and screaming at me whenever I get upset about something. For example, I'm not feeling well at the moment and I usually pretty much do everything around the house but tonight I was lying down on the couch after the eldest two went to bed and my husband was holding our baby. He told me he needed 15 minutes quiet time and then he'll do all the end of the night jobs (dishes, organizing daycare stuff for next day, feeding the cat etc) and gave me the baby and he went down to our room. 
After an hour I went down there to get something and he came back out with me. I was doing the jobs because it was starting to get late and I honestly didn't think he would do them as he doesn't often keep promises. He asked me what was wrong and I told him I'm super overwhelmed, unwell and tired. He absolutely lost it at me and kept screaming at me to ""shut the fuck up"" over and over and told me I'm and ""fucking ungrateful bitch"" 
My 6 year old woke up during this and heard everything. I don't know what to say to her to make it better

I'm so tired of this and I've told him I can't handle this anymore. He always tells me that if wasn't for me then he will kill himself. I believe him too because he's not really well in the head. I'm so lost on what to do.. please help me.

Detective thinks I coached the kids to talk about sexual abuse,8,"In the middle of a divorce from a covert Narc. After a school official witnessed an altercation, Children services got involved.  

For the first time I felt like I had the freedom to protect my kids... then, one of my kids tells me about a night I had worried about since it happened.  I reported it.  Months later after all the exams and interviews, Children Services says they were confirming the physical abuse but not the sexual, primarily because they didn‚Äôt have a third party reporter.  A few days later (last week), another child of mine tells me their father did the same thing for many years!   I ask the attorney and they said the detective thinks I coached my kid to say it so they didn‚Äôt have to see their father.  

I take the second one to the Psych today and inform the doctor that the child and I were having a conversation and they had indicated there were some things that sounded like they could be child sexual abuse. I asked the doctor if they could take the conversation from there.

My mom wants to be there, but I‚Äôm not sure I want her to be my support person. I have two best friends that hate eachother that both want to be that person for me.

Does my abuser deserve punishment?,10,"My ex bf was put on probation for domestic violence. He shoved me causing me to fall and hit my head. A time before that he pushed me on the ground and I fell and scraped up my knee. So now he is ordered to not contact me and if he does, he will go straight to jail. 

Well unfortunately I contacted him first after a month and said sorry. I missed him and I actually felt bad for calling the cops on him bc he never beat me or anything terrible. He begged for us to get back together, that everything would be perfect and blah blah. So we started dating again but things are starting to get bad again. He has not hit me or been physical with me, but the emotional and verbal abuse is BY FAR the worst.

When I try breaking up with him or blocking him he does not leave me alone. He will find other ways to contact me and harass me. I have told him if he does anything wrong (like touches me or verbally assaults me, anything like that) I will report him that is he now in contact with me, which would send him to jail. Am I being unfair???

I never actually did report him so he just doesn‚Äôt believe me. He said if I do he will kill himself. I honestly now feel so much resentment for all the shit he has put me through in the past and always letting him get away with it or making up for it by giving me gifts and stuff.

Left my abuser and he‚Äôs begging me to come back.,11,"I finally upped and walked out on my abusive ex of 1 year. Only returned once to pick up my belongings when I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be home.

He never hit me. BUT he cursed me out, called me the worst names in the book, constantly accused me of lying and cheating, was a problem binge drinker, did hard drugs. He didn‚Äôt work, had double standards, dismissed my concerns, had terrifying rage outbursts over the smallest thing, screamed in my face multiple times, threatened breaking up on the reg, everything was my fault, has thrown things (not directly at me), overturned and smashed furniture, and he was slowly isolating me from my entire support system. 

We broke up once and he threatened suicide and promised to change. I went back after a day. He was good for a couple weeks. Then it started again and gradually got worse. 

In an alcoholic rage, he threatened to kick me out of the car into the middle of a highway twice, at 2am. He has blocked my path and cornered me during a couple arguments. Pressured me for sex when I was clearly exhausted/sick and would pout and accuse me of not loving him when I refused over and over. Guilt trips out the wazoo. Misogynistic and racist comments and beliefs. 

The last straw finally came when I sat and cried in front of him, begging him to believe me that I loved him and never cheated. And he stared at me with the coldest expression. And then laughed at me. 

Of course, as with all abusive relationships, in good moments, he was fun, loving, sweet, kind and generous. Those times, I was so hopeful things were getting better and he would go back to being the person I fell in love with. 

He‚Äôs also physically disabled, but very mobile and independent, and I was attracted to his drive and ambition, and he came off very well adjusted and mature. 

It‚Äôs been 5 days, and he‚Äôs been begging me to come back. Promises of change, that he‚Äôll do anything to fix it. Promised to go to therapy, to AA, and get rid of all his enabling friends and family. Leaves me voicemails crying and apologizing repeatedly and saying he messed up bad, he can‚Äôt lose me, I‚Äôm his entire world. Everything I wanted him to do and wanted to hear. I stopped responding to him 3 days ago. He says he knows he‚Äôs lost me for real this time and he said it was a wake-up call.

I need to stay strong and since we live together, I‚Äôm trying to get out of the shared lease on the basis of DV. I guarantee his demeanor will change once he accepts I‚Äôm serious and he‚Äôs going to be stuck with the expensive place that HE picked to live in. 

I do have hopes he will change, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. I know people can change. I‚Äôm in therapy working on myself and doing the hard work and facing the worst parts of myself. 

Should I just stay NC? Or would it be worth it to send him one last message telling him to get himself into an abuser program? I‚Äôm not planning on going back, but I do want to hear your stories and just need some overall support. Thank you for reading all of it üôè",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

An ‚ÄúUnknown Caller‚Äù calls her about every 2 minutes, and when she answers, there is no response. This is obviously him, calling her to either intimidate her or keep tabs on her.

She is distraught and worried and so am I. This man is breaking his bail stipulations by violating the restraining order. But we have no technical proof that it‚Äôs him. Is there anything we can do?",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Extremely abusive/manipulative mom,14,"I‚Äôve been dealing with a mom that is extremely abusive. She is a stalker, she manipulates me, she‚Äôs paranoid, and she has called me literally every name in the book. Yesterday I was called names like narcissist, nasty, loser, and I was screamed at just for wanting to see a vaccinated friend. She has been controlling me excessively and barely takes me anywhere. She‚Äôs mainly just in it for herself. I‚Äôm worried she may become violent to the point where she‚Äôs physically abusive. 

Nobody believes me. Everyone I tell is blind to the situation. 

I‚Äôve tried to get help, but very few therapists know about the situation I‚Äôm going through. Also, if I notified the police and took her to court she would paint me as the abuser, as she has called me one and has threatened to call the police on me because she claimed I‚Äôm abusing her (I am not). She‚Äôs a pathological liar. She has also been stealing money my dad meant to give me for myself. In addition to that, I am ridiculed constantly for mistakes and she won‚Äôt let me be independent or make adult decisions. She won‚Äôt even let me go for walks. 

My dad is aware of her abuse but I‚Äôm not sure if he has my best interest in mind, as he only talks to me on the phone once a week about it. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an enabler but I don‚Äôt know if he cares enough to do anything. He told me to get a lawyer but again, most lawyers don‚Äôt get this situation and I would be stuck. I‚Äôm also afraid to make any sort of move due to her excessive rage. 

I‚Äôm suffering tremendously. I have no support, and barely make any money to support myself, as I have no motivation to go to work due to CPTSD.

I never leave the house because she thinks you can get covid just by stepping outside the front door and this continues to be true even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. 

At times I have thought about suicide, but then realize that while it‚Äôs a way out, it‚Äôs not a very good decision. Also I want to thrive and live. 

She approached me today and said she wanted to ‚Äústart over.‚Äù I don‚Äôt trust this sadly but because I knew she would rage if I didn‚Äôt comply I had to play along with the charade. She then inflicted emotional incest by treating me as her husband. She does this frequently, and doesn‚Äôt like me going places without her. I‚Äôm a 30 year old man.

Please help me understand my mother,3,"My sister and me were abused from young age by my Father. Initially it was my mom who was beaten, but then one time she started screaming and the neighbours came to stop the abuse and my father stopped beating my mom. My father started to take things out on my older brother and when he left my sister and me. It was really brutal, maybe not the physical aspect, but certainly the psychological one. I am am from Easter Europe, so there was a culture of domestic abuse there and I don't blame my mom for not knowing what to do back then in the 80-ies. Eventfully we have moved out and my Father did not have anyone else to abuse and it has stopped (at least the physical kind). Now he is an older man and does not seem to be even doing that.

I have my own family now in which this ""tradition"" has stopped. Unfortunately my sister has found and has been living with an abusive partner for a long while, even moved to UK with him and had 2 children and nothing we could do to stop it until recently. In the end the social services took away the children and now she is staying with me and seems to try to change things a bit, even though I know that she is still very attached to him. She is also struggling with alcohol addiction, but getting help for that. She does not want any mental health treatments and there is nothing I can do about it.

My mom was in this situation behaving very strangely. Initially she did not like the abuser. She has witnessed the abuse and has experienced psychological abuse from my sisters partner herself. She called him names and said she would witness to the police against him after a recent incident. But after a while of staying in my place she started to be angry with my sister. I don't know why exactly, but both of them were drinking and arguing. At some point she decided to go to my sisters ex-partner and I did not understand why, but she returned after talking to me. Then my mom left back to Eastern Europe to stay with my father. I was more than happy for that as she was miserable here. Now suddenly she decided to come back, without notifying me. Initially she tried to do it a month ago and my nephew has bought her tickets, but she did not have proper documentation for COVID. My Aunt warned about this then. When I talked to her she said she was going to go live with the my sisters \[ex\]-partner (the abuser). I talked to her and she said she would not go afterwards or talk to him anymore - he is a very manipulative person. Then just today I learned she is trying to go again. I have called her and warned that if she decides to stay with him I would break all contact with her. It would break my heart if something happened to her, but I cant be involved in that situation. It is my concern that if my mom stays there that it will normalize the ex-partner relationship again and my sister will go back to him and restart the cycle of violence. I do not think the children would be returned in that case. I do not understand how my mom could do something like that. She is old (around 76) and she has memory problems, but I do not believe it can be to this extent. Is there anything else I can do to get my mom back?

Me. A case study.,8,"Just a little thing I wrote while having a stress headache. 

I went back again and again. 
How many times do we go back on average? 
I'm sure I meet or exceed that.

And one day I left. 
And of course again I went back.

But there was a defining moment, one night while I looked up at an unfamiliar ceiling, my face burning, shining with tears, stinging with pain. My stomach in knots but somehow so hungry; wondering if continuing the charade was worth another day, I realized I did deserve something.

I deserve to live. I deserve to be happy. I deserve to believe in something. 

 It is painful, it's so hard.

People will use me, my children, anything I have they will take if it means they can get what they want. 

I should be very very very careful who I trust during this process. 

I wrote my story out for me. 
One day maybe I can share it here. When everything is calm. 

When I was finally mentally able to do so I
Collected my own data, went back, read old conversations, looked at patterns. I had calenders and bank statements, vacations we took and fights we had, gifts vs physical abuse, surprises vs names being called. 
How many times had he called me out of my name in public or otherwise and I didn't catch it? 
How many times did I just let his venomous words burn into my skin and bleed love back into him in return. 
How many more things was he going to hurt.
How many more times was he going to hurt me. 
That's why we never had pets. 

Years and years and years it took me to realize I was even being mistreated at all. 
I watched a million videos and read a million articles to convince myself it was abuse and I was not crazy. 
I read your stories.
I went back through my finances.
In doing this I found that I had let him siphon thousands and thousands of dollars from my accounts.
I lost tens of thousands in items he broke, ruined, or otherwise destroyed. 
I lost time. I lost friends. More than material possessions for sure. 
The damage done to my children mentally.

I was amazed that I was in such a trance. That I did so much, so blindly and took so much damage, but hid it so well.
For me at least, seeing it on paper made it clinical. 
I could look at it as if it weren't me, but a case study of sorts. 
It is a long road and we still have quite a way to go. Many more court dates ahead I'm afraid.

"I know what to do, just want to discuss my situation",2,"I'm a 20 years old guy currently living in one of the biggest cities in Netherlands and want to discuss the situation between me and my asian parents.

When my mom was pregnant of me, she found a house she wanted to buy but my dad refused, because it was on ground floor and an ""easy target for burglars"".
 Since that decision was made, we lived in a rental apartment until I became six years old and we then moved a floor down and we still live here, on ground floor.

 The problem here is that the house she wanted to buy had a room for me, and where we live currently there isn't. For many years, until I was 17 or so, I've slept on a double bed above my mom and I had a desk area for myself in our long living room. My dad promised to build a wall there to make a room for myself when I we moved here. He sleeps on the sofa in the same living room. If you wonder why my parents don't sleep in the same bed, it's because my dad's snoring sounds like a lawnmower.
 He broke the promise of building a room many times and obviously I had gotten enough of sleeping in the same room as my mom and disassembled the double bed with a friend and moved it to my studying area/""room"". So for all my life I've had no privacy at home, because my dad didn't let my mom buy the house on ground floor.

I've been raised with asian parenting, and for the problem child that I was, I got beaten a lot as a kid. Got punched on my skull by my dad, slapped in the face by my mom when I angered them or actually did something wrong.
 After primary school I got bullied a lot in highschool and already started smoking weed with my primary school friends when I was 13, because I had nowhere else where I truly felt home. It impacted my motivation to do well at school and I couldn't finish my college at 17 years old, by that time I had already experimented many other kinds of drugs. So in my parents view, I'm the first failure in their bloodline. Three years after dropping out of college I quit smoking weed and picked college back up again and am soon going to get my degree, finally.

 Recently the point of beef with my parents is why I'm still here. I have a part-time job as an assistant-chef in a restaurant but in the country I live, renting a room is very expensive. I acknowledge it's my fault that I'm still leeching from my parents and didn't finish college three years ago, with my diploma I could've gone to university and lived in a room off student grants.
 
Tonight my dad had trouble sleeping because I was calling a friend, and with the corona curfew I couldn't have the convo outside. Multiple times he shouted at me to shut up which woke my mom up. She works hard and makes most of the bread for us so she was super pissed at me for keeping my dad awake until he started shouting. She came into the living room and smacked me in the face for making my dad shout. I started reasoning that it's not entirely my fault for being in this position. 
Since I understand that what my parents have been doing to me isn't normal in Dutch norms and values, I started threatening my parents to call the police whenever they resort to violence. I did the same today after I got smacked my mom tried to slap my phone out of my hands when I started dialing the sos number. I was on ropes and pushed her back lightly to keep safe distance because I don't want any of the violence but she then bit my hand which kinda hurt. We argued back and forth and at some point I told her she was right, because she never stops. I never won an argument with her because she often is in denial and never stops.

 Technically yes, it's my fault for still being here at this age but it certainly isn't my fault that I don't have my own room nor the wall my dad promised to build me. So what I'm trying to imply here is that he has no right to yell at me when I'm doing my thing, because he messed up in the past, broke the promise which he resulted into him hear me speak loudly with my friend on the phone tonight.

I know what I need to do though. After my college degree I'm planning to work more and rent an anti-squat apartment which has cheap rent in exchange for having no rental rights. Live my own goddamn life. If you ever find yourself in a toxic environment, try to find an exit asap. My parents love me and don't know how to express it the right way, and this house just doesn't have room for me. I know that once I leave they'll miss me and I'll miss them. But most importantly that's going to be healthy for all of us. And the violence part is something I'll never do to kids. It's bad and could get my parents in jail, but that's also not something I wish they deserve because I really am good for nothing at the moment.

I just wanted to get things off my chest here and discuss if I'm right or not. Was pretty hot-headed when I started writing this post but am much calmer now and can view things objectively.",TW Physical Violence

Was my mother abusive?,3,"My mother is singlehandedly the most enigmatic person I have ever met. She spends years living as the most idyllic nurturing parent a person could ask for and then she snaps into these episodes where she becomes my worst nightmare. In fits of rage, she has threatened many times to us starting around the age of ten to commit suicide if we do not comply with her wishes and she can be almost neurotically controlling of our personal lives. I recall one time where she threw my sisters cello at her for not practicing enough and another where she cornered her in a lavatory and screamed things at her that I have to much dignity to repeat. The night she found out my sister was gay, she held on to the car she was using to get away from her deliberately injuring herself I suspect so that she would stay with her, later that night she would accuse me a fourteen year old at the time of desiring to sleep with men (in much more colorful phrasing) and than proceeding to threaten to sue my father who is one of the kindest most selfless men I know for having assaulted her by not suspecting that she was insane enough to cling to a moving car.

I remember a horrible weekend not one year ago where I was forced to accompany my mother and father on a vacation to ensure that they don't murder each other where after threatening to jump off a balcony because I wore a shirt she didn't like, she screamed that I was unworthy of any of her money and that I would be written out of her will, brandished a wooden spear at my father, and the next day stalked me and my father for miles and sobbed uncontrollably in my arms for daring to take a taxi home without her.

There have been many incidents where I have been forced to run away briefly and stay at another persons home the most recent one being my fifteen birthday where she tried to physically fight me for wanting to stay at home. I have called the police on her no less than three times (I still don't know if the situations necessitated doing that btw) the final one resulting in her being forcibly interned in a mental institution. On top of this, she acts borderline anti Semitic to me despite the fact that she herself converted to Judaism to marry my father. For example she once yelled that she knows I'm Jewish because I care about her only for her money like all of us filthy Jews (which is not even true by the way, I couldn't care less if she writes me out of her stupid will) and will make snide remarks to me when I'm coming home from synagogue or will mock me and sometimes start screaming if she catches me practicing my religion in front of her.

But the most confusing part of all of this is that these episodes are always unexpected and out of character for her and she generally is an exceedingly kind and loving person and whenever I have brought these incidents up with her she appears to have little to no recollection of them. I also have many friends who are forced to live in much worse predicaments and the threats of sexual violence, poverty, neglect, and substance abuse so many people I know have had to endure were non existent in my childhood. I just want to know moving forward if I truly have a right to resent my mother for being abusive or if I'm just a spoiled kid who wants to complain about something.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning

Conflicted and feel to blame?,2,"I‚Äôve been in what I would describe as an emotionally and physically abusive relationship for 3 years. The past year my depression became so severe I began drinking alcohol to cope with my anxiety and hopelessness. I know that was the wrong and irresponsible thing to do. 
My ex has called me pathetic, loser, that he‚Äôd kill me, has hit me, sexually assaulted me, told me I make his skin crawl, etc. and why on earth I never left is beyond me (hoping counseling helps me with this). 
My drinking took a sever turn when I began binge drinking every couple of weeks. Which led to my eventual rape while passed out (not by my ex). This further traumatized me and I was diagnosed with ptsd. At first my ex was supportive, but turned on me and threatened to come after me, that I asked to be raped, it was my fault, and so on. Which deeply disturbed me. He eventually apologized and said that I was putting him through a lot and he was under stress. It had always gone this way so I just naturally accepted that. He offered to take me on a weekend getaway and enrolled in counseling to help him learn to control his temper. I agreed, as I usually did and of course the weekend turned into him laughing at me hysterically for being raped and when I became upset he hit and choked me. I finally snapped out of whatever trance I was in and filed a restraining order. Which was very hard for me, but I somehow just knew this would never end until I did. 
Fast forward to the court date and he has an attorney. The asked for a continuance to gather more evidence as they questioned and were highly concerned for my mental well being. His attorney said his client was very supportive and just absolutely sick over what could have prompted me to do such a thing. So now we must wait almost a month for the next hearing. I am so stressed out because I was already having such a hard time filing. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I‚Äôm being ridiculous. My ex was very supportive of me and my struggles.....until I pissed him off and he‚Äôs use it all against me in a heartbeat. I do love and care for him and almost feel bad I‚Äôm betraying him. I often wonder if somehow I caused all this from him. I don‚Äôt know, I hardly make sense to myself. 
However, at the same time I feel like a giant weight has been lifted from me. I enrolled in support group for alcohol and haven‚Äôt drank in over a month, enrolled in individual counseling to treat my depression and ptsd. Find myself feeling more like I did before this relationship. Even reconnecting with friends and family I couldn‚Äôt always talk to freely while with my ex. 
I know I didn‚Äôt handle my situation the best or with any grace at all. I know I messed up in a lot of ways and made terrible, life impacting decisions that I‚Äôm sure even hurt my ex at times. I‚Äôm also sure I did cause him worry and concern for me when I was at my worst. I‚Äôll admit to all that and feel nothing but sorry for the corncern and hurt I caused anyone close to me this past year. 
I also know he‚Äôs been at the very least emotionally and verbally abusive since almost the beginning (3 years ago) and he‚Äôs still continuing to make it all about how it‚Äôs my fault. I only want to do the thing that provides the most relief and healing. And I‚Äôm confused! And now I‚Äôve gained the attention of his sister who has since text me that I was a loser, she hopes I die, sat behind me in court and kept saying I was petty, etc. so that‚Äôs really stressing me out as well.

"Detective contacted me about DV incident, now won't respond. Help needed!",2,"I received a voicemail going on 2 weeks ago from a detective regarding a friend of mine and their partner. I called the detective back that day and left a voicemail, no response. So I called again, maybe 5 days later and left another voicemail, still no response. 

I was able to get ahold of said friend the day the detective called me so I know they are currently out of the house and staying somewhere they feel safe, at least for the moment. I had heard about their partner being abusive previously, there was at least one incident I knew of where they were hit by their partner. I was informed by my friend that it has escalated significantly, as well as was worse than she let on (which I totally understand and wondered about anyway, since that often happens). They have children together and my friend is afraid that their partner will kill them and/or the children. From the details I have heard, this has become an extremely serious, dangerous, and urgent concern.

So, what should I do? I live a few counties away but at this point, I feel like I should just show up at the police station that the detective is from. I am really annoyed/angry/concerned that a detective would leave a voicemail saying that they needed to speak to me about ""a domestic violence issue I may have insight on"" and then never return my call. I do have insight on this as I have known their partner before I even knew them and can attest to many things I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes.

I had a friend murdered by her partner in a domestic violence situation that she was trying to get out of, so this has really triggered all my memories and fears from that, the trial, etc. I can not stand to see that happen again. 

Is this even normal for them to just not respond? Should I report that to someone at their station? Any advice is appreciated!!

Question about Clare‚Äôs Law (UK).,6,"Has anyone ever used Clare‚Äôs Law? I rang my local police department to do some checks on my partner and they‚Äôve asked me to come into the station to speak face to face so I can show ID etc and she told me on the phone that they will want to know what‚Äôs prompted me to ask.

I keep convincing myself that things aren‚Äôt that bad and I‚Äôm making things out to be worse than what they are. They don‚Äôt happen all the time, it‚Äôs intermittent and when he‚Äôs nice he‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôm so stupid for brushing past the things he‚Äôs done though, convincing myself that I‚Äôm happy and I want to spend my life with him.

I'm scared that my abuser will find/stalk me even if I escape and go no contact..how do i deal with this,3,"I am an (adult) child who grew up in domestic violence and other bad things. Both my parents were  abusive in different ways but I guesse I was more afraid of my dad as he was the who held any real power over me. I endured alot of extreame abuse but i dont want to waste time writing about that in this post. I struggle alot with my mental health and was isolated from everyone even extended family so I have nobody to ask for help. Ppl always say just move out, but just cuz a child in an abusive house turns 18 doesnt mean everything magically gets better and they have freedom...not it's not that easy to move out. I had alot of barrier (most of it being my mental health and overcoming emotional abuse) to moving..plus I only work a min wage job rn. My mental health is still bad but getting better and I think it's getting good enough to be able to move in the near future....but one thing that stops me is that I am afraid my dad will stalk and find me and harass me. I'm.afraid even if I escape and attempt no contact he will find me somehow. My sister thinks i am being irrational maybe I am but he didnt abuse her like me he just neglected/ignored her so she isnt as afraid of him. When I went to university i went to a school kinda far. My dad never cared or talked to me much my whole life but he is clearly has many mental issues including abandonment/control issues. So he would call me often to prevent me from ""abandoning"" him but could never  hold a convo for more than 2 mins max, so I started ignoring his calls.  So he drove to my apartment (in a different city) hours away unannounced and didnt even knock but let himself into my apartment. I was not home so he harrassed my roommates to find me....and then when I cam home he had fake tears. After that he often would show up to my apartment unannounced and I would just have anxiety on the weekends thinking if he will come this week or not and I will be forced to interact with my abuser so he can feel a sense of control. He is really abusive and mentally ill and over 30 ppl that I know of have cut contact with him including his family (his siblings). But he stalks all of them. So I am afraid that he will do the same to me but it will be even worse if he finds me becuae I think he thinks that he owns me like property and I have no right to leave. So I  kinda dont think its even worth it to leave....as it wont solve/stop the abuse. Has anything similar happn to anyone else.....do you have any advice for dealing with an abuser who will not let you go.",Preparing To Leave

still living with someone who hurt me badly,15,"Describing my situation with some (very brief) details of the violence:

During a fight at the beginning of the year, he nearly suffocated me and gave me a concussion. There hasn't been any of that type of violence between us since then except one time after a verbal argument, where he more or less said, 'I want to do that to you again but I won't'. I've moved in and out of the house since but after experiencing worsening PCS (post concussion syndrome) symptoms am now back again, trying to focus on recovering some of my health which I've felt moving around so much has not helped me do. This is his apartment. Before I moved in, I was living in a rental that was affordable to me at the time, however, is no longer since I only just finished school when I moved into here, the pandemic had just started and am now still mostly not working and am still pretty sick from PCS (read as: I cannot afford my own place right now). He is gone a lot of the time (weeks at a time) and will continue to be until the summer, when he leaves for work for a full 3-4 months. I am in ongoing therapy and he has gone to a few therapy sessions that afterwards seems to give him a positive shift in perspective. I am pretty convinced at this point that I will need to leave the house and the relationship eventually. However, I also want to focus on doing the things that make me feel like I am on the right track for my recovery. And when I was moved out, I was really struggling with finding a situation where I could be more comfortable than I am here (sans fights). Right now, it honestly feels to me that I am in the best worst case scenario although I realize it is still risky. He did do me serious harm. He could have even ended my life. I don't think that is what he was trying to do and I also don't think he would purposefully do that, although of course I have read the statistics about abuse escalating. Considering all the pros and cons, I feel that for myself, right now, I am leaning towards staying (maybe at longest until the summer when he is gone for the longer period of time) and focusing on my health and recovery as being the best option for me. 

My question for the community is: 

If you were in my shoes, what would you do and over what period of time? I am looking forward to hearing more perspectives, especially given that I do, in fact, have brain trauma that is no doubt affecting my reasoning skills. 

One more thing that I will add for those who have never had brain trauma before: 

In my experience of living with PCS, it is like having a very strict limit on your energy level. It feels like I wake up with a set amount of energy to try to do the things I want to do, hoping that at least some of those things are what will eventually help me to make a full recovery and/or give myself an energy boost for upcoming days. I try to eat some brain food, do a couple social things, do some chores, do some exercise, enjoy some screen time, knowing that if I push myself too much in anything that I could bust and 'lose' the rest of my day. I'm finding that pacing myself is very important. A 'bust' may not be life threatening (as far as I know) but it has its consequences and sometimes I feel the effects of a bust for days, weeks. At least for me it is a big factor in knowing that if/when I do move out again, it will take a lot of my energy to do so.

The cop showed up and basically told me I did the right thing by calling, and told us we can either get a restraining order, or have her committed to a mental facility since she has mental disorders (or ""pink slipped"").

My mother was very angry, and basically threatened to call the cops on me and have me arrested if I ever called again. I told her I didn't care, as my sister doesn't have a right to vandalize stuff and hurt people even if she is family, and her bipolar doesn't excuse it either.

Fighting with Myself (About Them),5,"This will be a lengthy post.

Part of my posting is to help me to tell myself that this behavior was never okay, and I need to stop making excuses for them.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

For some context:

My ex (23) and I (22) were together on and off (mostly on) for almost four years (started in 2017). This was the longest relationship I have ever been in. 

We had been through some of the worst hardships I have ever experienced together. For most of our relationship we were homeless (living in a car or tent). We drove across the country together. For almost the entirety of 2019, we were stranded in an unfamiliar state far from our home state (we live in the United States).

They have struggled with addiction since long before we first started dating. In the beginning of our relationship, I didn‚Äôt really understand how severe their addiction was. I will also mention that I was not fully committed to the relationship when we started. I had some serious issues with fidelity up until early 2019. Our relationship was never perfect (I keep having to remind myself).

Sometime in late 2018, their verbal abuse started transferring to physical abuse. The first time they slapped me, I was completely taken aback. I had never been hit by anyone, or even been in a fight. We had a sort of explosive break up after that. We started talking again maybe a month or so after that. Nothing physical happened again for some time after that first instance.

When we got stranded in a different state, they started to hit me more often. I received my first bloody nose and black eye from them in our tent in the midst of a verbal fight. They were high. They were always high when they hit me.

The next few times were out in public away from our tent. They head butted me in the middle of a sidewalk, and a passerby yelled out the car window to them. She got out and tried to help me, and I told her I was okay. I‚Äôm not really sure why, but I couldn‚Äôt walk on my own after that for a little while. Every time I tried to walk I would fall to the side. I had to go to the ER and they gave me a diagnosis of ataxia. I told them I fell and fell flat on my forehead.
The next time I can remember after that, they brought me to a swamp right by the main road and had me on my knees while they were striking me on my head screaming at me. Some people were walking nearby, and they must have called the police because the next thing I knew my ex told me to run. l did.

There were always instances between incidents where they would tell me how much they needed me and how sorry they were. They would tell me they could never be in this situation without my help. Whenever they would sober up, they‚Äôd say they couldn‚Äôt even understand why they would do something like that. They didn‚Äôt stop taking drugs.

We left that area, and we stayed with an internet friend of mine several hours away in the next state over. The physical abuse stopped for a time, and they went back to just being verbally abusive. They would tell me about all the ways they wanted to hurt me, how much they hated me, how worthless I was.

When we left my friend‚Äôs, we went for a work exchange back in the state we had been stranded in. This period of time is a blur, but I don‚Äôt think there was any physical altercations. There was a lot of threatening, though. This location was the most beautiful place I had ever seen in my life, and I was living on edge, walking on eggshells always. Always trying to keep up appearances, and make sure they didn‚Äôt get into trouble. We were there for a month, and then we went to a decent sized city when we had to leave the work exchange.

Here, we lived in a tent. There was not a lot of physical abuse here, either but there was always a fight around the corner. They would threaten me a lot, and when they weren‚Äôt threatening me there word be words of admiration and love.

I would overlook the verbal abuse because I really did love them so much. They were my world, my purpose, and my guarantee that I wouldn‚Äôt be alone in this predicament.

In October of 2019, the physical abuse started again. We had an altercation because I told them that I didn‚Äôt want to be with them if they were using drugs (they had been trying to stay sober at this point). They had relapsed, and it was always a fight when that happened. I picked my things, and I was going to leave. They weren‚Äôt letting me leave. I dialed 911 because I was at my limit, and I felt physically threatened. They punched me in the face when I hit the call button. The 911 operated answered as I was crying in pain. They sent the police, and my ex fled. They said that even though I wasn‚Äôt pressing charges, there was enough evidence (blood on my clothes and my face swollen) that the state had to press charges. They were arrested. There was a state mandated no-contact order because of the nature of the crime. When the time came, I went to the bail hearing myself to talk to the judge. I convinced them to unsecure the bail, and remove the no-contact order. I lied and told them that this was the first time this had happened and it was an issue of addiction and needed to be dealt with as such instead of a domestic issue. My ex was mandated to attend a substance abuse treatment program for three days every week. They went diligently and stayed sober until their hearing. When the trail date came, I brought them, and I got their charges dropped.

After that, we broke up because they had found a ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù (there was a girl we met who was going to college and they told me they wanted to break up with me and start trying to go to college). I told them I was going to go back to our home state if we were broken up. They told me to do what I needed to. I left, and they went right back to the drugs. As soon as I was gone, they started verbally abusing me on the phone again saying that I had abandoned them. Things with the girl didn‚Äôt work out, so after all this I ended up buying them a bus ticket back to our home state.

Fast forward to us living together again in early 2020. We lived with their mom, and they were often verbally abusive again. They were using drugs often again, and I always knew when it would happen even when they didn‚Äôt tell me. We broke up again after they stole some of my medication to get high on. They hit me again, and I had my mom pick me up.

I don‚Äôt even know how things got back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù after this. We kept going back and forth like this every so often. I kept going back. I just loved them so much, and I could see the good life we could have if they‚Äôd just put down the drugs.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The current situation:

We broke up most recently on 03/03/2021.

They had been seriously trying to stay sober, things had been mostly good for a while. We had an apartment, and the problems we had were normal. I had to go to inpatient for help with my psychiatric medication. After I was released, I came home to them having been binging the whole time I was in the hospital (5 days). They had also broken the lease by smoking in the house. They got evicted for this, and still hadn‚Äôt admitted to using, but I knew they had. I told them I wasn‚Äôt going to help them anymore if they were still okay with being dishonest with me.

They went to complete war with me. They packed all of their things, and I brought them to their dads a few hours away. They tried to take both of our televisions, and I told them that I was keeping the one I bought. They punched a hole in it before they left. The whole car ride they were screaming at me about how they wanted to kill me and eviscerate me with their bare hands. They said their life‚Äôs purpose was going to be to get me to kill myself. I kept pulling over on the ride because I told them I didn‚Äôt have to be helping them, and that I refused to drive while they were screaming at me.

After I dropped them off, I didn‚Äôt hear from them for a while. They had blocked me everywhere, and had made it clear that I was never going to have ‚Äúanother chance‚Äù with them.

A few weeks ago, they unblocked me to say they wanted to have one last conversation with me. I responded. We ended up talking for several hours about spirituality, and our insights into the higher self and oneness. We ended up agreeing that we didn‚Äôt want to get back together, and that it was nice to be friends without all of our ‚Äúego bullshit‚Äù as we called it. We were actually having a healthy friendship.

They relapsed on Thursday, and I ended up hanging out with them to try and help them feel better. I had other reasons to see them (give them some things), but I just wanted to be a good friend. I thought they could put our history aside like they already had in previous encounters.

They started by being really irritated at first, then they started fighting me. The fight escalated, and they broke my car windshield by punching it.

I told them that was too far, and that it was unacceptable, and I was going to be bringing them back to their dad‚Äôs house. After some more verbal abuse the entire drive down to their dad‚Äôs (deja vu from the last time).

At this point it was about 4:30am on Thursday morning. When I went to drop them off and leave, they started asking me a question repeatedly. I gave them an answer, but they didn‚Äôt like the one I had. They turned to the passenger door as if to get out, and then they turned back quickly and hit me in the face somewhere between 10 and 20 times. They then jumped out of the car telling me they never wanted to see me again and to leave now and never come back.

My head was spinning as I couldn‚Äôt block all of the blows, but as soon as I could manage, I locked the car doors and rolled the windows up while dialing 911. There was so much blood, I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was just my nose or my nose and my mouth. I was hysterical on the phone with the operator. I‚Äôve never liked to see my own blood, and there was nasal tissue that was really scaring me. The police came and helped me through things. I looked like a bad rendition of a zombie movie extra. The ambiance came and took me to the hospital. I had to leave my car near my ex‚Äôs dad‚Äôs apartment because I couldn‚Äôt see to drive (they broke my glasses while hitting me). I got x-rays done at the hospital, and my nose is broken.

My ex fled the scene as soon as the police arrived. They haven‚Äôt been arrested yet. The police are actively looking for them, though.

Despite all of this happening just barely over 24 hours ago, I can‚Äôt seem to shake the feeling that I am abandoning them. I can‚Äôt help but feel so guilty that I have made this decision. I don‚Äôt know how to break free of this mental block.

It‚Äôs like half the time I am so blinded by my love for them, and the other half of the time I am disgusted at myself for having these feelings for them through all of this.

I don‚Äôt want this for myself anymore. I want to feel safe all the time. I don‚Äôt want to live without them in my life. I don‚Äôt want to ever be with this version of them ever again.

I don‚Äôt know if I really can say there is another ‚Äúversion‚Äù of them. I don‚Äôt know what I think. I know I feel such deep sorrow, though.

I went back and it wasn‚Äôt good,8,"I went over to his house cause he wanted to hang out, we had gotten on to good speaking terms he said all this right things (I know it was stupid I know) but when I got there it was clearly not good. He was so mad at me and just sat there listing things I had done wrong, how this was all my fault, asking how could I leave him over a mistake? And then saying that it wasn‚Äôt even bad, he just choked me he didn‚Äôt hit me. And then he says it only happened because He was drunk, but he said ‚Äúif I was sober I would have known what I was doing and it would have been so much worse‚Äù which idk what he meant but I felt so scared. He also started saying he would take my dog and I just became so scared I left but he started running after me, he‚Äôs now begging me to come back and I just don‚Äôt Know what‚Äôs going on.

I have to testify and I‚Äôm terrified.,11,"*tw- violence 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I was in a short-lived relationship that ended in a violent episode where my x choked me twice before leaving, once resulting in my passing out. After the episode he left and unknown to me, filed a police report claiming we had a fight but stating he wasn‚Äôt injured and didn‚Äôt want to file charges or do anything. The officer noted he wasn‚Äôt injured. In my state, if he was, they would have immediately come to at least talk to me and probably arrest me. Nothing happened and I wasn‚Äôt even aware until 5 days later that he had taken any action. At the time, I was stunned and in shock that this person had tried to kill me and it took me awhile to process the gravity of it so I didn‚Äôt immediately file charges. I went to three intense trauma therapy sessions in the span of five days to try to process it. My x had been staying in my home and had some expensive items delivered after the incident so on the advice of some lawyer friends I reached out to him to let him know these items had arrived. He never answered me over the weekend and the following Monday went to family court to file for a temporary order of protection. In my state anyone and everyone can be granted a TOP.

The order was complete fabrication where he contradicts his own report that he made with the police. When I was served the sheriffs advised me to go and file criminal charges, as I was bruised and visibly injured. So I did. The fact that he‚Äôd make such grandiose false claims made me incredibly fearful of him and what he was capable of. I felt like I was dealing w a true sociopath. The results of these actions are that there‚Äôs a criminal trial again him and a civil action against me. 

So now the civil trial is coming to a head. Given that he‚Äôs a defendant in a criminal case, everyone expected him to let the family court order against me expire because having him testify to a fabricated story on the record can and will be used against him in criminal court. I have an attorney who has met with his ‚Äúvictim‚Äù advocate multiple times and while she agrees with my attorney that this was filed to try to intimidate me and because abusers try to blame-shift, she can‚Äôt compel him to not to force a trial. So a trial in this family case awaits me and a criminal trial in the charges I filed probably also awaits me. 

I haven‚Äôt seen him since the incident. The trial will be on zoom but despite this, I am terrified. Truly terrified. He‚Äôs coming out with these clearly doctored photos claiming injuries and I will have to relive that day in his presence again in order to refute his nonsense claims.  I will have to sit there and not react to obvious lies and fabrications. I will have to try to remain calm as this person who tried to kill me lies repeatedly. I will have to contain my fear so I can speak my truth. And I think he will enjoy seeing how terrified I am. I truly do. And I think seeing me will increase his obsession with me when all I want is for him to forget I ever existed. 

I‚Äôm not really looking for advice. This person tried to kill me over a very short relationship ending. I guess I just want to say that this is why victims don‚Äôt come forward‚Äî the pure terror of having to relive the terrible incident over again, having to be non reactive  to false claims made by someone who tried to end your life, having to deal with a legal system that allows this shit to go on. Having to deal him potentially winning in a court where the burden of proof is much lower and him reigniting his feelings about me. I understand why anyone and everyone should be able to file for these orders. But this tactic by abusers to try to paint themselves as victims is disgusting and should warrant criminal consequences in order to deter them.",TW Physical Violence
Today marks 5 years since I left.,10,"April 1st will forever be a day burned in my memory. 


It's the day the lightbulb in my head finally lit after 3 years of emotional, verbal, and physical abuse. I was done. 


My abuser was my (now ex) husband. An angry, jealous, narcissistic a** hole. I'm proud of myself for leaving when I did. I'm certain that if I had stayed much longer, he really would have killed me like he threatened to do so often. 


Sometimes I still experience flashbacks and panic attacks at certain triggers. But I've gotten so much better because of therapy, and my wonderful new husband. 


I want you all to know, that it does get better. You deserve better. You are not what they say you are. You're worth everything this world has to offer you and don't let anyone tell you different.  


I literally got on a plane and flew about 8 states away to be rid of him. I never spoke to him again after telling him that I would be back. I knew I was lying when I said it, I was so afraid he would see through it and not let me leave. He almost didn't, but his wonderful Father called the police and then told him they were on their way to come arrest him. That finally made him run for it, and I escaped. 


I took out a protection order and had divorce papers served to him. Without the help of the people who supported me, I don't know if I could've done it. There were so many sleepless, tear filled nights. But I did it. I got my life back. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve the happiness that I've gained now. His lies still echo in my mind. 

 "" You're worthless. No one wants you. No one even likes you."" 

""If I hadn't taken pity on you, no one would've ever married you."" 

""You're ugly, stupid, disgusting.""
 But they were all lies. All false statements to make him feel better about himself. Because his own precious ego was all he cared about. 


You are worth it. If you can leave, do it. The sooner the better. There are people who love you, who care for you. They want you to be safe. I want you to be safe.

Thanks for the memories,5,"For those who were in long term abuse situations, do you ever have flashbacks of just random moments in that relationship and realize, wow, that was also very abusive. I was being physically and mentally abused for years. Without knowing. Even the more intense physical abuse, I just didn‚Äôt see it. 
The flashbacks come at random, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm above watching a scene in a show. I think ‚ÄúI feel so bad for that girl‚Äù and some point I realize that girl is me, and if even for a second I feel all of that pain again. The fear. The sadness. I was abused for 5 years. I don‚Äôt remember much of my sons life, because that‚Äôs when the abuse was the worse. I always feel guilty for knowing more things about his older sister. Four years ago, we hadn‚Äôt been together for years, he found me and held me hostage in my car with a gun. He got off easy and he‚Äôs now in and out of jail for other things. Still in and out of the children‚Äôs life as well. I‚Äôm in therapy. I take medications. I am in a healthy relationship. I am engaged to be married this December. 

Do these memories go away? Should I try and work through them or stop thinking about them?",TW Physical Violence
I slept with my abusive ex last night,8,"I slept with my ex last night and I just need to vent. I‚Äôm really angry with myself right now. It‚Äôs been a little more than a year since I left him after we got into a fight where he was drunk and he slapped me and I hit back. He beat the shit out of me and threw me into a mirror. I decided I was done helping him and a line was drawn in the sand and it was crossed. It was really difficult for me mentally after that. He apologized profusely afterwards and I forgave him, but it still gets to me sometimes. He showed up at a get together with some of my friends and he looked so much better. I didn‚Äôt even know he knew the same people I did. And we really were just back to the time where we couldn‚Äôt get enough of each other. I‚Äôve been acting pretty crazy lately and I told myself fuck no don‚Äôt go there when I saw him. I ignored him for a while, but eventually talked to him because I do really care about him and wanted to see how he was. Little bit of alcohol later and I just completely made the decision and ignored everything I told myself not to do. I haven‚Äôt really given a fuck about myself lately, so I guess that‚Äôs what I get for not taking care of myself and being self-destructive. 

Anyway, can somebody relate? I know it‚Äôs a pretty shitty thing to do so you don‚Äôt have to tell me. I‚Äôve recently started to see a therapist so I obviously have a lot of things to figure out and work through.",TW Physical Violence
"Boyfriend suspects I'm leaving, is suddenly nice...",3,"Over the past several years, I have been experiencing, what I didn't realize, could be considered abuse. It started with things I didn't think twice on, like him saying I didn't know any better when I stated my opinion or getting me to cancel plans with my friends, and that I shouldn't work at my dad's business because he treats me unfairly. I didn't think anything of it, because he showered me with affection. Flash forward seven years....we buy a house together. We have two kids together. 
    I have no friends. I have limited contact with my family because he tells me they are horrible people, and they don't support ""our"" family as a unit.  He has somehow got me to stop working for the past five years that we have owned the house together. I have no say in finical matters, he has maxed out my credit card. I have tried to start working since the second child because it makes.me.feel better..since I've been doing so, he wants a joint bank account, and to be able to dish out a stipend.  And since he can no longer claim me as a dependent, he wants us to get married so we can file jointly. And that if I don't, I don't support the family as a unit. That I'm being selfish and selfseving for wanting to handle my own end. That he says, that's a deal breaker for him.
   Since the second child, I've had my eyes opened. One particular instance, where I had her in my arms, he waved a fist at.me, like he was going to hit me. Since that, I've noticed more and more, and feel like I've been snapping back to reality ( and myself) and coming out of a dream like state. 
    He has seemingly gained control over.my whole life..wanting access to all of my photos on google claiming it's because he can see the kids. 
     Hesitant to leave because of the kids. Of I'm not around to protect them, what if he gets shared custody. That honestly scares me more than staying. He has Misophonia and will refuse to care for the kids if they are  crunching on something. 
     Then suddenly,.he hands me a letter of sorts, of his hes taking responsibility for his behavior, asking if he has irreparably damaged things. .I answer out of fear of giving him my real answer, idk. Now he is being overly nice....and trying to help with the kids, not that I can't trust it.because of past behavior. Then he mentions trying to get us to go to his aunt's private cabin. A very secluded area for.two months. And a chill runs up my spine. He keeps trying to force the issue though I said, two weeks would be one thing, but I have my work. I feel somewhat fearful at his suggestion and change of behavoir. Am I being paranoid? He's also severely depressed, on antidepressants, and adhd medication.",TW Physical Violence
Cycling Through An Abusive Relationship,4,"I broke up with my abusive ex again, after we've been on-off fighting. I can't do it anymore. He asked me if I was leaving him again today and he asked me to, so I dressed myself to do that multiple times, and he would continuously attempt to block me from leaving. At one point he was actively standing in front of the door and told me to punch him in the face if I wanted him to move. 

I obviously didn't because wtf?

Following that I left to go home, and he asked me to come back in then physically picked me up when I wouldn't go back to his bedroom with him.

Physical fight with BF,8,"(Lengthy) I‚Äôm 23 and my bf is 30. We met a year ago, started dating in august and in a relationship January. A couple of days before Valentine‚Äôs Day he blacked out on alcohol and attacked me. I explained in another sub the details of the incident. He left me with broken and bleeding nails, bruised back from pushing me down multiple times, punched me, pulled my hair and prevented me from leaving his apartment. The police showed up but we didn‚Äôt answer. Once they left he held a knife to his neck threatening to kill himself if I walk out. He tried to get to his safe where I assume there was a gun. I wouldn‚Äôt allow him to get to it because I was terrified. I stayed with him for the night because I couldn‚Äôt go home to my family in the condition I was in. The next day he blamed everything on the alcohol and begged me not to leave him. That he loves me and I‚Äôm his everything. If I leave I‚Äôll be taking everything away from him. He began to lovebomb me with gifts and treats. Ever since this happened I emotionally checked out. he begged me for another chance. He blew up my phone and showed up to my house unannounced begging to make things right, so I gave in. A couple of weeks past and during an argument I brought up his abuse and he said ‚Äúhow long are you gonna hold that against me?? You know that wasn‚Äôt me it was the alcohol‚Äù.  It has only been two weeks and he expected me to forgive and forget before my wounds were healed. I told him he‚Äôs has an addiction and all he did was deflect to the only time I got sick from drinking, compared to the multiple times I took care of his drunk ass. I never met anyone who mixes Taylor port and Hennessy everyday all day and swear they don‚Äôt have a drinking problem. It was so disgusting to watch him drink. He didn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt talk much or have sex with him. He thought I was torturing him for no reason. 


A few weeks ago my mom got terribly sick and I was stressed out. I wouldn‚Äôt answer his calls as I was busy taking care of stuff. He sent me an angry text and said ‚Äúyou act like I‚Äôm the one who got your mom sick‚Äù. Idk what is was about that one phrase that sent me through the roof. I told him we‚Äôre over and to leave me alone. Of course he showed up to my house unannounced and brought me a bag full of candy and a bunch of apologies. We had a short conversation when he realized I was serious he snatch the bag and threw it into traffic. He called me the next day asking if this is what I really want. He sent threatening text messages and says he has enough money to run if he does dirt. Yesterday he said it‚Äôs not over unless HE says it‚Äôs over.

I hope it's OK if I vent here,6,"I don't really know where to start, but I feel like I have to get my thoughts out. Somewhere. Whether or not someone reads it. 

It's been a couple of days and now I wonder why I'm still fixated on it. Doesn't seem so bad, really. Does anyone else start writing their thoughts out and chuckle at all the classic ""abuse victim lines"" they are accidentally saying?

We were playing around, we'd had a little to drink, him more than me. He was swatting me on top of my head, we were laughing. I swatted him back. Laughter stopped and his eyes went black, I could see his cheek muscle twitching as he flexed his jaw.

I must have smacked him harder than he was smacking me,"" I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to hit you hard. I'm sorry, I was trying to  copy you, I didn't mean to hurt you. Did I hurt you?""

No fucking answer of course. Just silent,  not answering me and standing there glowering, chest puffed out and eyes narrowing. Just like my dad. I always knew, you can tell when they just want to smash your head into the counter. 

""Really? Really, you're this upset? Don't be like this"". Urging him to act like a normal fucking person and respond to me. I tentatively put my hand on his shoulder and he reacts, shoving me hard on my diaphragm and knocking the wind out of me. Both elbows are on fire from landing on them, one bleeding. I begin sobbing uncontrollably because what else can I do? 

""If you hadn't been hitting me"" he says. ""You can't just smack the shit out of me, why didn't you stop hitting me?""

Someone posted something here the other day about how they can't view themselves as the bad guy, so they remember events differently, and gaslight with their new memory. He's sorry that I hurt, but I shouldn't have tried to pick a fight with him. That's how he remembers it. 

It's not like this happens all the time, but every couple of years there's an incident that only I remember. He insists I'm making things up to make him the bad guy, if I ever bring it up. 

I don't feel as betrayed as I did that night, but I feel like I don't want to be around him anymore. Our relationship has been strained for the last year,, but now something feels severed. We have 2 small children that have medical issues that mean I can't put them in school or daycare until they can be vaccinated.  I haven't worked in 13 years, and am only halfway through my degree. 

I'll stay for now, maybe forever. But I know now that I NEED to finish my degree and certifications so that if I have to, I can leave and financially support myself. He's been asking me to go back to work for a couple of years, but now I'm on the same page. I feel so sorry for my girls if we end up divorced.  It's not fair to them. It's not fair to me either. Maybe it's my fault? Maybe I'm overreacting. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I can't talk to anyone in my life about this. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel like my kids are bricks I've tied around myself. I'm so stuck unless I put everyone through a huge upheaval.",Preparing To Leave
How do I deal with my abuser and his family with coparenting? I‚Äôm scared for my baby and myself. They‚Äôre also making my life hell.,6," I‚Äôm sorry for the length I wanted to give as much necessary information as needed. I was engaged and found out I was pregnant a few days after. We‚Äôve known each other since 2014. I thought things would get better and he acted better around the time he proposed so I thought he wasn‚Äôt like that anymore. He just used to be really hurtful and rude with comments and cheat when we were younger never really physically harmful. During my pregnancy, he COMPLETELY escalated to this whole new level. My son‚Äôs father started threatening at first to kick me out because I was crying. I had a broken foot and heavily pregnant. He would just stare at me struggling and walk away while trying to get my cast boot on because of my pregnant belly it made it VERY difficult. I got to where I walked against doctor‚Äôs orders without it because he refused to help me unless people were watching him. One day my pregnancy emotions and frustration with the boot I started crying and he told me to get out, leave my ring, and he would send child support. I went to get my purse and he started throwing things around the room. I covered my belly to protect my baby and he became angrier. He then just acted like it never happened and went back to playing video games. It happened again, the next time he said if I tried to leave he would slash my car tires and make me wait for family to come get me. (They live two hours away from him.) he started making cruel comments as jokes saying ‚Äúwe destroyed his dreams.‚Äù He called our unborn baby a ‚Äúbastard spawn‚Äù as a joke and I got upset he adamantly denies he said it, but I heard it and he said it to my face clear as day. I texted to my mom and best friend as soon as it happened because I was so upset and I knew if I called he would hear and get violent. He eventually started throwing things in my direction, and almost hit our unborn baby in the head with a gaming controller and threatened to shoot items within arms length of me while sitting next to his loaded handgun. I left to stay with my family during my last trimester it was my obgyn‚Äôs orders in case I had complications or went in labor early they didn‚Äôt want me so far from them. He told me the day I left if I didn‚Äôt bring our child back to his family within a week of birth, then he would take him by force to bring to his family without me. I said I was breastfeeding and his only response was ‚Äúthere‚Äôs formula.‚Äù I immediately told my family. I reached out to my local domestic violence they told me under no circumstances should he be present or aware of the birth and he shouldn‚Äôt be on the birth certificate. I didn‚Äôt inform him and eventually his sister texted me until I told her a few days after. She was already aware I told her I felt unsafe around her brother before the birth since the violence has increased. She did nothing. He called her  4 year old daughter a ‚Äúlittle bitch.‚Äù They kicked him out of their home. His family is VERY aware of his behavior, but are blaming me. When it happens to them though they blame him. I‚Äôve never had this issue with past partners, ONLY HIM. Things have only got worse since. They keep saying I took the birth and his name from him. I‚Äôm upset. He doesn‚Äôt provide for our baby, he made me feel so scared and unsafe for our baby and myself that I didn‚Äôt include him. I was genuinely afraid he was going to take him as threatened. He said I could recover there and he would help me. He didn‚Äôt help me when my foot was broken even though he had been told multiple times by my doctors and me that he needed to. I was afraid of being stranded and not having help too while recovering. My mother saved up her vacation from the time they were told of my pregnancy just to spend it helping me recover and teaching me about child care, as this is my first baby and I have no experience. His family was making parenting choices saying they could overrule me on decisions involving our son‚Äôs care if they agreed and I didn‚Äôt. They actually tried on a few things before birth.  Saying I couldn‚Äôt have our son sleep in our room in a crib or pack n play. That he needed to sleep down the hall without a baby monitor they felt that was better than my preference. I‚Äôve tried giving him opportunities to co parent and be civil, he just does more harm than good with our baby. I had our baby sleeping in his own crib in the same room from his first day home. He spent time with him and tried to force sleep training at 2 months old. Our son now clings to me in my bed through the night and cries immediately if set in the crib for any reason. He would also yell at me in front of our baby and call me names, and now if anyone starts raising their voice whether happy or mad my son gets HIGHLY upset. Both my baby and I are both VERY on edge and upset anytime we stay for periods with his family for them to bond. My therapist appointed by the domestic violence office said she was SEVERELY concerned for my mental well being and my son‚Äôs every time we stayed there we seemed so different and bothered. I was considering suicide but didn‚Äôt for my son. He started physically harming me, and the verbal as well as emotional abuse significantly increased during our visits. I would then take our son and leave to go be at my parent‚Äôs home. His family is angry that I left with our baby and don‚Äôt stay with him. They said I need to give him more respect to get respect. I tried everything I could to make it work. I heard him VERY agitated with our baby and got worried and went to ask if he was okay and needed to talk. I asked if I needed to take our baby and give him a few minutes. He called me a ‚Äúfucking idiot.‚Äù In response. His mom witnessed it and just said to leave her out of it. He stands by calling me that and said ‚Äúwell you were being one.‚Äù He also stood by throwing things at me saying ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt that hard.‚Äù Or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like I really beat you.‚Äù He pushed my head while I had our son in my arms and said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt that hard, that‚Äôs not abuse.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt support our baby, every time he is involved with his care something negative happens to our baby. He gave him MAJOR doses of cereal in his bottles he felt he was eating too much formula and his doctor said he can no longer have cereal at all. Forcing the sleep training to the point our son refuses to sleep alone now, our son gets VERY upset if anyone raises a voice after he did it a lot around him, saying comments like ‚Äúif he smothers on a flat surface he deserves to die, natural selection.‚Äù Then he would laugh. That comment has been made twice now. I told him in one instance I needed to go to the bathroom in the next room and I would be back to please watch Him. He didn‚Äôt have headphones on at the time and was listening and looking directly at me. I then walked in on our son flipped over and smothering two foot from him and he didn‚Äôt even notice because he was playing video games. I screamed and ran and grabbed him. His father just lifted his headphones calmly and said ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre soundproof.‚Äù Then went back to his game. I took our son in the other room hysterical checking him over to ensure he was okay and didn‚Äôt need medical attention. I called my mother crying after that incident saying we couldn‚Äôt do this anymore. Our son just cries so much more in their home as well. He is like a completely different baby around him than when he‚Äôs not present. Everyone who has been involved in raising him so far and knows him well says it‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt bring the same child home and they‚Äôre super concerned. His family has been saying how awful I am for not staying, saying how he deserves his last name and I should have never taken the birth moment from him, saying I need to give him respect constantly. I have honest to God tried to be good to this man and he is constantly insulting me. I hold it in until I contemplate suicide and realize I can‚Äôt be around this behavior and neither can my son.

"He body slammed me, and now I‚Äôm in a fog",7,"TRIGGER WARNING: PHYSICAL, VERBAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE, VICTIM BLAMING 

My boyfriend and I have been having issues for many months . We had a massive breakup a year ago that was further made worst by him bringing in multiple girls and building relationship/situationships off of his hate for me, and made sure to deal with any person I ever had any type of issue with ). Anyway, we have both been toxic to eachother, with him making friends of anyone  I had conflict with, lying to others to cause me to have issues with them and me following up with his lies by engaging with the other person (his girl best friend) and then for me and her to later find out he had been lying to us both. I have also participated in this activity by taking him back then deciding on a whim to leave, nasty words during arguments etc. but overall most of our issues had centered on his indecisiveness, his lies coming to fruition , and his inability to not do something drastic when me and him aren‚Äôt on good terms


Anyway, yesterday I invited him into my house (I live with my parents) while they were not home, which I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do but I did it anyway (we are both 18, just graduated high school early, start college in fall). So at first we are just talking and he brings a gift. I make a joke like ‚Äúoh this is for one of the other girls you‚Äôre with lol‚Äù and he says no it isn‚Äôt and offers me his phone so I can see he‚Äôs telling the truth. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt look at the phone bc I‚Äôve gotten my feelings hurt many times looking through his phone, but I was like why not and started looking. I saw in his phone him and his best friend calling me ugly, him lying to her about us being together, and the revelation they had sex at some point . It was also him texting other girls about how he doesn‚Äôt care about me, he‚Äôd never be with me, I‚Äôm a ‚Äústupid bitch‚Äù and how I need to get beat up, telling them about my family life, my insecurities , etc. Basically telling them one sided stories of our breakup. Him and his bestfriend are no longer in contact however because he did some bs to her as well. Either way, those messages were extremely hurtful to the point me, who  usually is very mouthy, just stopped talking and walked out the room into my room with nothing to say. 


He then followed me into the room, and while I was in the room I had gotten on the phone with my bestfriend to calm me down bc I didn‚Äôt want to cry in front of him. He immediately got angry and said ‚Äúwho is that on the phone?‚Äù I said ‚Äúnobody‚Äù and then he was like ‚Äúso you‚Äôre really going to be on the phone with another guy while I‚Äôm here‚Äù and then I told him it was my friend . He then walked out of the room and I later (5 mins later) returned to the room we both were in and sat down. He looks like he‚Äôs about to leave but then he comes back in the house, pretends he‚Äôs looking for something and knocks the bottle I had next to me on my body. I still didn‚Äôt react bc I was thinking ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs so petty‚Äù but then I started to get legit scared when he threw a bottle across the doom and then kicked the chair I had been sitting in. I was so angry he was destroying MY family‚Äôs property that I got his phone next to me and dropped it (not throw, drop). He checked his phone, realized it wasn‚Äôt broken but then got angry I picked it up anyway.He immediately took my phone and was aiming it at a window , then when I tried reach for it he shoved me to the ground. HARD. My whole body completely hit the ground, and I was knocked into a wooden table .


I was so shocked, all I could do was get up (I‚Äôm a petite female , 5‚Äô2 120 lbs. he‚Äôs a football player . 5‚Äô11 170). As I got up, he hoisted me over his shoulder , dangled me over my steps , as I‚Äôm screaming begging him to let me go because I knew if I tumbled down those steps I‚Äôd really be hurt, so instead he turned around and body slammed me into my couch, once again, HARD. I just felt heat up and down my body bc it‚Äôs not a soft couch. It‚Äôs a very rigid , old couch without much cushion (it‚Äôs leather) so I felt every bit of force. I‚Äôm still sitting there hurt and then he just breaks down crying . He starts hyperventilating , claiming he never meant to do that etc. he has ‚Äúa lot of pressure on him‚Äù and he  ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to hurt me but he just keeps hurting me‚Äù , how I deserve better nobody loves him etc etc and then leaves . 


However, he later calls telling me he knows I won‚Äôt tell bc he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in the house so I‚Äôll get in trouble and he‚Äôll make sure my parents know I was being ‚Äúslutted out‚Äù by him and how he will make sure to expose me  . But then I spoke to one of my friends about it the same day and she urged me to tell bc I had not grasped how serious it was . So  I told my parents everything . My dad was very upset, claiming I shouldn‚Äôt call myself a victim however because I put myself in a vulnerable position and how I just need to move on , not speak with him and not press charges.


My mother on the other hand was LIVID. She contacted his mother, a behavior therapist for me and everything. The last thing he said to me was after my mother contacted his mom, and he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre reallly trying to play with me , huh?‚Äù . Now I just feel kind of alone bc on the other hand friends of mine are telling me how serious this is and my mother is even getting me therapy, but my dad on the other hand is claiming it‚Äôs not that big of a deal and to learn from it and move on. When I said I was a victim of abuse he sent me a article of ‚Äúself victimhood‚Äù and to never call myself a victim. It makes me doubt myself, as in was this a one time thing? Was he just very angry? Is this who he is as a person? We are both still fairly young and my father kept saying it was more than likely a mistake and contacting police would really hurt him and it‚Äôs not that serious . I loved him so much and it hurt so much to be betrayed so many times in one day. 


I do however realize how serious it is to end it, because he wasn‚Äôt really so much hurt about what he did to me, in fact he kept making excuses (‚Äúoh I threw you into a couch, not on the ground) and that this relationship was time to end. But now I am trying to figure out what else I need to do to protect myself . He knows where I live but I am unable to press any criminal charges, restraining orders etc. bc it‚Äôs been decided I just need to move on with my life. What scares me is he seems even more mad I told and he‚Äôs extremely unpredictable and now I don‚Äôt know what to do bc I‚Äôve heard of girls being killed , and after yesterday I‚Äôm not going to keep underestimating the lengths he will go.


ETA: He also chose to go to my dream school, and while we were on good terms claimed it was bc he wanted to follow me into the next stage of life . So in a few more months I will be an hour away with him on campus with me",TW Physical Violence
There was so many things that were wrong,4,"TRIGGER WARNING: Emotional and physical violence.

I didn't realize it until I grew into a more emotionally stable person who has found some love for herself. I didn't know that I was not the ""crazy one"" until he had no reason to tell me I was crazy.

He would shove me on the ground, punch me and afterwards tell me that he wasn't even using all of his strength. There would be a bruise and he would shame me saying that it wasn't that bad, that I was being a baby.

In the moments where he broke my trust and I found out, it was all my fault. What I was seeing wasn't the truth, I needed to believe him. And so, I did.

I would cry and show him the pain that he caused while he just laughed at me and motioned ""fuck you"" signs at me. I would spend hours in bed wiping my tears away because of the things he had said and done and he called me crazy for it.

When I was giving birth to our still-born child, he complained the whole time during the process that lasted about two days. Not once did he think about the physical and emotional pain I was feeling in that moment. I had to beg him to stay by my side so that I wouldn't have to do it alone.

I was crazy for being emotional, I believed it. My mind told me that I deserved it for the mean things I said when I lost it.

When he needed help, I needed to do it right away. I had to go help him or he would belittle me. So, I did. He offered me car rides to work in return for those times. Of course, I paid for the gas alone and the car repairs were split in half.

He filmed me when I would freak out and those were the only memories he would keep of me on his phone. He said it was just in case. He once told me he would have me put in jail and would be my worst nightmare. He said he would show the videos of my freak outs to the cops and they would put me in a mental institute or jail, at least that's what he said. I obeyed and stopped expressing what I felt to him.

He controlled the amount of time I would spend in the shower and the time at which I would go. He would threaten to break all my things when I spoke of leaving to have control over me. He would belittle me when he didn't feel good and always tell me he was the best at everything. He crushed my dreams whenever he could.

I had a custom product idea recently and I was thrilled to work on it. I did everything from A to Z, the website, logo, product manufacturing, etc. I had not yet launched the product and I told him I didn't care wether I earned money from it or not, I was so passionate and I had so much fun doing it. I learned and I had low expectations for the launch. Yet, he still felt the need to put me down and tell me that I was dreaming and I wasn't living in reality. He would tell me this every day for weeks. I didn't listen to him this time, I kept working on it.

He then called me selfish for doing something on my own and wanted me to do him more favors by helping him with his idea. I agreed to help him. That same day, after he had said that he expected to make millions from his own idea, I told him to stop dreaming so much and have lower expectations as he had previously told me. He didn't take it well, he started insulting me and saying that I did something bad years before I met him. He was accusing me falsely and that hurt a lot.

I said things back to him to defend myself and of course, he punished me by taking away the internet so I couldn't work on my idea. He blocked my access completely. He says he won't be giving it back. I pay for half the things and he pays for the other half, and yet he still feels he can do this to me. I am using data to type this message, I needed to vent somewhere.

I feel so trapped and I just wanted to feel heard somewhere. What is the best way to get out without major consequences? He tends to be very aggressive when I speak of leaving and I don't think I even have any love left for him, I am just scared of what he is capable of. He has already had the cops called on him in his previous relationship when his ex was leaving because he was acting aggressively. He could even go as far as making me look like the one who is doing wrong in front of the cops. I just don't know what to do... Should I call the hotline? What was your course of action in a similar situation? 

Thank you.

TL;DR: I feel trapped in an abusive relationship because of what could happen to me if I leave. After working on myself, getting to a point where I am emotionally stable and doing well, I am now able to see more clearly that I was not the only one with issues in this situation. I get scared at the thought of leaving and having this man stalk me or doing something even worse than that.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Abusive Grandfather Need Help ASAP,17,"
Hello Reddit! I'm looking for some advice here. I live with my grandparents, and we are having some real problems with my grandfather. He has always been abusive, but now that I'm 22, and clean and sober (I was addicted to opiates ever since my mom died when I was a sophomore in HS) and I'm tired of constantly hearing him scream and threaten us. I want my grandmother, and the rest of our family to be able to be happy, and not have to constantly walk on egg shells around him. I have listed all of his red flags, all of the abuse that he does, and I've likely missed tons of it, but hopefully this list will give you some insight and help you guys understand the situation enough to give some advice. I guess the ideal outcome would be if he were to go get help, maybe get on some psych meds to keep him a little more calm. I just don't know what to do because all he does is threaten violence and to kick me out (I can't be kicked out, because I help my disabled grandmother and she would never sign an eviction) 

What can I say or do to make him change? He knows I'm keeping videos and pictures of the abuse so I can do something about it soon, and he threatened to go to the police with a bottle of needles he saved from last year when I was doing drugs. I don't know what he expects to accomplish, especially considering I have no drugs in my system, or possession, and he has all of the needles and drug paraphernalia, as well as his marijuana (and whatever else he does) stuff.

Here is the list of what he does, and for the record, incase there's any relevant mental health laws, I live in the state of South Carolina. My grandfather is like 56 years old, and my two children sisters are living with us until their father gets clean. My grandfather used to be an alcholic, and much worse, and he's sometimes nice and does things for us like fixing our cars free and buying us lunch, but the toxic outweighs the good by a ton. Please help us. We do love him, we just want him to not be so violent and we want us all to be happy, him included, but we can't take much more abuse.

His Red Flags:

Threatens SUICIDE
Threatens to SHOOT my grandmother, myself (his grandson), and his son, Chevy very often, and he has access to firearms.
SCREAMING and YELLING over small things, like someone used his charging block, and he will threaten to hurt people over small things like that.
SEVERE DISPLAYS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE in front of his young grandchildren
PUNCHES or SLAPS my grandmother
SPITTING on my grandmother (this is his go-to attack, it happens SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK)
He has plenty of access to GUNS, and HE SAYS THAT ONE DAY HE'S GOING TO SNAP AND KILL MY GRANDMOTHER.

Misplacing things and then becoming hostile claiming others have stolen the items that he misplaced.
Constant screaming and threats of violence over VERY MINOR THINGS
Threatened to ""go outside and beat me to a bloody pulp""
Gave him $100 to keep safe in his locked safe, and he STOLE it instead of keeping it safe.
Leaves notes around the house calling others names and threatening, like on his charger, and such places.


ADULTERY (cheated on my grandmother, she was kind enough to forgive him)
Hardcore MARIJUANA USAGE, spending hundreds of dollars a month on marijuana.
Constantly DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MARIJUANA, but I'm not sure how it effects him, so this may be safe.
Leaves marijuana paraphenelia in my grandmother's car, and all around the house or outside on the porch.
SEVERE ROAD RAGE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/ VERBAL ABUSE IN PUBLIC PLACES, such as resturants, says severely innapropriate things, and insults my grandmother, 
It's not uncommon to hear him say ""Shut the fuck up you fat hog or I'll shoot you in the fucking face bitch"" or things like that

Possible pornography addiction
Nicotine addiction

It's getting worse,6,"I wrote a post 2 weeks ago about what my boyfriend did (threatening to slap me, grabbing me by the back of my neck, pulling my hair, etc) because it was getting more and more frequent and I was wondering how to stop it.

Everyone in the comments told me that he won't stop, that the situation will only get worse and to leave immediately. (If you commented my previous post and see this one, I'd like to thank you for caring and giving me advice) 

Well, I should've listened. Today he got angry because there was no clean socks and he had to leave. 
He blamed me, said  I should've think about it. Them when I responded that he could've done it himself he threw objects at me.

Punched me in my leg. This is the first time he punches me during an argument. When we are playing he sometimes lightly punches me, this time it didn't feel the same.

Then he put his knee on my leg where he pushed me and pressed with all his strenght.

I didn't beg even if it hurt like hell. So he kept going for a long moment.

He raised his fists multiple times torwards my face, told me ""wait for when I'll really do it""

Grabbed me by my jaw. It also hurt.

Pressed his arm on my throat I couldn't breath, he said ""I'm not even using strenght don't act like you're choking"".

Said"" wait when will I come back you'll regret it"".

My husband justifies abusing me,23,"My husband is abusing me

I (44F) met my best friend (42M) 23 years ago. 
About 5 years ago, we took it to the next level and had a romantic relationship. It was a bad choice, lasted about six months, and afterwords we have stayed friends. 


The trouble now is that I married (31M) last year and he‚Äôs gotten progressively more abusive. 


Started with calling me a stupid fucking cunt, then bruises on my arms and face, biting me, etc. He‚Äôs tried to put trackers on my phone and insists I‚Äôve cheated. 


He threatened to divorce me if I didn‚Äôt cut male best friend out of my life and I put my foot down and refused. 


He finally told me last night that even though he‚Äôs going to the totally nude strip club, bought drinks for strippers, and smoked 
 meth while he was out traveling for work, me hanging out with my best friend that I was at one short point romantically involved with is the reason why he is abusive. He said it causes him to feel like he‚Äôs being disrespected, so he doesn‚Äôt feel that he has to respect me.


He said what I am doing to him is so much more disrespectful than him buying drinks for strippers or putting his hands on me.
I feel like I‚Äôm in the twilight zone.


Will someone tell me that it‚Äôs OK for me to get away from this man and that me being friends with a man that I was involved with for six months, five years ago, and have been friends with for over 20 years is not a reason for him to put bruises and bite marks on me.

How can I find a way to cope with trauma from domestic violence,1,"Hey. So this is gonna be a bit long. From december 2019 to june 2020, I was in a relationship with a man. Signs of unhealthiness appeared from the first month, but I was too young (17 years old) to understand what was happening. Disrespect, insults, sharp words, no communication whatsoever. But I was stuck in the narrative that ‚Äúa good woman should stay with her man no matter what happens and true love survives through anything‚Äù. Cheating, financial control, frequent breakups, humiliation... he truly did it all. In august 2019, we started living together in a studio. Things were going bad as always. He started to throw things, slap or shove me, or even lock me in the apartment. I used to have so many bruises and be in complete denial. On December 23rd, we had a big argument. We were supposed to go to his parents the next day for Christmas Eve. He said something really harsh to me, and I kept trying to tell him how I felt, but he would put his headphones on everytime I tried to talk. I took his headphones off once, twice, and the third time he gave me a look that made me scared to death. I ran to the bathroom (which was like 4 feet away) to hide but he opened before I could lock it and hit me on the head very hard (‚ÄúIs that what you wanted?‚Äù). I was completely knocked out for five minutes, laying on the floor, drooling. I opened my eyes and saw he wasn‚Äôt there. I got up and walked to the room and saw him laying there, playing games on his phone and laughing. The next day, we went to his parents. He spent the whole day complaining about ‚Äúwhy do you always look so sad, could you enjoy a little and not look so upset in front of my family‚Äù.
Long story short, this has happened over a year ago. I broke up with him in June 2020 and never spoke to him again. The thing is, I cannot let go of this event. Every time I try to talk about it, I end up in tears. I get random panick attacks, especially when triggered. For example : last time, my mom was chasing our cat in her apartment, saying ‚Äúim gonna kill you‚Äù because he peed on her bed. This triggered memories in my brain and had me crying uncontrollably for 30 minutes, shaking, hiding and curling up on myself. I was completely paranoid. I had to go out to calm down. This happened another time when a guy I flirted with said we were gonna fight.
This is getting out of hand. Do you have any advice I could use to stop all of this? I have tried a shrink already and it does nothing for me.

A few months ago we traveled back to my hometown to clear out a storage we had there, and so we ended up going out for a few drinks (bad idea) long story short I woke up in jail not having a clue how I got there or what happened neither does he.

Once my husband and I got new jobs, the three of us moved out to an apartment near to my sister‚Äôs place. 4 days after moving in, my husband, started touching my body after I had said no. I said no again and removed my hands. He leapt over my sleeping daughter and struck me across the face.

He never called me names or hit me before, but he's doing both now. He's hit me on 3 occasions and seriously threatened me last night saying he was going to upper cut me and punch me in the face

Luckily I found it in the living room (where HE put it)

He's talking all kinds of ridiculous shit, space, time, clones, dimensions, like I can't even talk to him when I try. He's been mean about my body, age, called me a bitch at *least* once a day. 

We aren't sleeping together anymore, he leaves the room when I walk in, he will literally stand in place and mumble & wave his arms around for hours, throwing away stuff we use, I found my brand new shampoo bottle damn near empty, & so much more, 

It hurts bc he's nothing like this usually and has *never* hit me or called me names until now, but I told him im scared of him & don't like who he is on this drug & he needs to stop doing it & let me throw out his stash or he has to leave and do it elsewhere.

He says he's leaving, but there was a flash flood last night so I said he could wait, but he's supposed to leave today.

Usually every 6 months or so we'd have some big fight over whatever bullshit and he'd talk down to me, insult me, push me around, keep me from leaving, and I'd eventually leave and end things for a few months then end up getting back together.
I became more aware of the pattern and my own mental health and just got really worn down/lost feelings for him and ended things forreal after an incident where he was drunk and punched me in my head and slapped me. Usually things would not get that intense and it scared me away, finally.
We were apart for almost a good year and then my dumbass saw him doing so well and accepted him back into my life. I set boundaries, and did not move back in together, and things have been a hell of a lot better than before.

Like this is supposed to be what I win for putting up with abuse, and maybe even like I still think no one else will love me inside? And how can I abandon him when he's ~finally~ trying to be better for real.
Its making me feel so trapped. Almost feels like I'm waiting for him to snap back to being abusive so I have a ~valid reason~ for leaving. I'm not sure if its the resentment or if my perception of him was clouded by the constant chaos but man I don't like his personality that much. It feels like a chore to act like a couple with him. He's still extremely insecure, scared of abandonment, scared of getting cheated on and boy it pisses me off/disgusts me. I can't help but see this dude as pathetic, and I'm not even attracted to him anymore, but I can't make myself hurt him without feeling like it's justified.",TW Physical Violence
Venting/ need advice,14,"New here, just wanted to vent and see what others have to say. I dont feel comfortable explaining everything but for background, my husband and I have been married for 2 years but known each other for 5 years. We have a son and I'm 36 weeks pregnant now. We agree on pretty much everything but we struggle with emotional things like talking about feelings or being some type of connected with each other. I love my husband very much and I still think he's a good person.

So basically my husband has been physically and emotionally abusive since July 2020, not every day and not every single month like the last bad time was november. My husband right now is in therapy and he's also in a program that does group therapy and I'm in individual therapy. My husband was doing okay, he was getting good at not getting frustrated to the point where he puts hands on me when we argue but today was horrible. We got into an argument about some of my insecurities and I felt he wasnt being supportive and it spiraled into him pushing me off the bed, scratching up my arm and then twisting it and then trying to put me in a chokehold. My point in telling you all this is to ask . Will he ever really change or is my marriage doomed? Do I have to leave him because this is all he'll ever be? 2. Why cant I bring myself to leave him or let him go? 3. What did I do wrong to bring out this abusive character in him? 4. Is it my fault that he's abusive? Should I just not talk about how I feel with him? He calls me the abusive one any time I get upset at him or if I say I feel like he isnt engaging with me when I talk about my feelings. Or that I'm overbearing and it's too much that he cant deal with me and my emotions. I dont know what to do anymore

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I being abused? Am I abusing him?,22,"My bf is sweet kind and compassionate EXCEPT when I confronted him about his phone. 

During covid I finally snuck into the phone he had been guarding with his life and found out he was doing some shit that he shouldn‚Äôt be doing if we‚Äôre in a relationship together.

When I confronted him about it he trashed our apartment. He threw tables over and threw things at me. I think he hit my legs and butt with a wooden dowel. There were bruises. He said he couldnt believe I was going to break up with him over something so dumb and became suicidal. He was rageful and said awful things to me. He said he hated me and he wanted to kill me. He scared me.

I cleaned up the mess. He unlocked his phone. He gave me the passcode. He said he loved me so much and he was drunk and he‚Äôd never done anything like that before.

Eventually I saw more upsetting things on his phone. He was talking and sexting with an ex girl friend as our relationship crumbled during quarantine. He locked his phone again without telling me.

I asked to see his phone and he called me a cunt etc and threw things at me again.  He said I was controlling and a bad influence on his life, and that I‚Äôm manipulative and verbally abusive because I always accuse him of lying and cheating when he‚Äôs not.

We live together and I haven‚Äôt had a place to go until now. I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm leaving, that I need my own space, that we‚Äôre in a toxic loop, and I can‚Äôt forget the things he‚Äôs done to hurt me and if I‚Äôm hurting him and making him miserable and verbally abusive like he said I am, I just need to be alone and go to therapy. 

He says I can trust him, that he doesn‚Äôt want to be with anyone else, that he hates himself for hurting me, and he wants to spend his life with me. He doesn‚Äôt want me to leave and says he won‚Äôt be ok if I go. He says I don‚Äôt understand or believe how much he loves me. He is doing everything he can to get me to stay, cleaning, buying me flowers, sleeping in the bed with me instead of on the couch, looking nice, being affectionate, he bought tickets to something beautiful to attend in April. He said he‚Äôll take mushrooms with me, which I‚Äôve been asking him to do with me and we never get around to even though he‚Äôs experienced with psychedelics. He‚Äôs making all the efforts I wish he would‚Äôve made a year ago when we moved in our apartment. I feel like it‚Äôs too late but maybe I‚Äôm crazy and I‚Äôm throwing away a loving relationship. I do love him but i feel resentment and hurt that is very deep.

I‚Äôm afraid for him. He said he feels like a loser bc he‚Äôs unemployed due to the pandemic. He drinks too much. He said if I leave to just get space I‚Äôm just slowly breaking up with him. He says he can‚Äôt stay in the apartment if I leave bc it‚Äôs OURS and it‚Äôll just remind him of me. I‚Äôve never paid rent.

I dont want to let him go. The relationship is anything but healthy.,5,"I'm in a highly toxic non relationship with a man. He doesn't want a relationship with me. He's got a best friend that predates me that wants a relationship with him and I'm not allowed to feel any sort of way about it because we're not together. And everytime we fight about anything I always end up getting hit. It got really bad about a month ago because I had to call the local authorities on him and he left me with my face beaten to a pulp and broken bones. He was gone for about a week and managed to come back. My face healed up and it got better, but then it just started up again. 

The cops were called again the other day and they actually took him to jail for domestic violence. He got out and came to get some of his stuff. I'm currently unemployed but have a way to make money, so I offered to pay him cash to use his vehicle because the cops confiscated his cash. His reply was that he wanted to come back and play the game at my house every once in awhile. I tried to tell him I don't want you living here anymore. Like this time last year I would have done any f****** thing for this man. But now, I told him how I felt. Nothing changed. Like I would put up with damn near anything for this man and we're not together. And he seems really disappointed that I don't want to keep giving him chances because when we get along it's really great and we can work together and make money and help each other out. But for me it's the combination of being treated that way in my own house, and knowing that even if the fighting magically stops, I'm still in this weird unnecessarily extra love triangle setup and I don't feel like sitting around waiting for him to decide that maybe he does want a relationship with this girl, nice knowing you. 
Okay and he tells me that he could possibly love me at some point when he gets his s*** together, but we've been living together with this friends-with-benefits thing for almost 2 years and if it didn't happen before I don't think it's going to happen now. When we fight he makes a point of mentioning how he doesn't want to be here. It is crazy as it sounds if he wanted to be here then I could try harder and do better so that we wouldn't still be fighting. But why should I keep holding my tongue for a man that's not even mine and a house that actually is mine? I told myself after the cops came last time I'm not biting my tongue for him anymore if he doesn't like it he can leave. I told him the same thing. 
No I don't actually think that he ever did anything inappropriate or sexual with this girl oh, I just hate the position that I was in trying to help someone and seeing if maybe it could be something more, too whatever situation I'm in now. He left first thing in the morning yesterday, and only came back when I was gone to drop off the dog. But I haven't seen him or heard from him since then.
I don't know if he's hurt somewhere or sleeping in a car. I worry about him and I miss him. I think hes either giving me space or trying to make me miss him. Especially with his stuff still here, he took about half of it , but if he were actually all the way gone and his stuff wasn't here it would be a lot easier to not miss him amd try to move on and forget about him. 

But what if I put my foot down and actually make him leave this time and I'm forever alone because nobody else will want me? What if all it takes is me trying harder to make everything better and I ruined a potentially great friendship? And I know how it sounds versus how it is, which is why I posted in this thread instead of relationship advice, to hopefully hear from people who have had a similar situations to mine.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
restraining orders,3,"hi there i have a couple questions about getting a restraining order against my ex. basically i tried pressing charges against him almost a year ago, on the police report the listed charges would have been felony kidnapping, domestic violence, third degree assault, and misdemeanor kidnapping. the case went inactive because the picture i had of bruises didn‚Äôt have my face in it, he bragged about abusing me on twitter but didn‚Äôt say my name, and i never (got the chance to, he‚Äôd take my phone and keys) called the police while it happened. i did have medical documentation of my injuries but i didn‚Äôt even get a chance to submit it before the case went inactive. his roommates also witnessed him abusing me but the police never talked to them idk why. basically they probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to prove without reasonable doubt that he did these things. 

it was disappointing but i‚Äôve still tried my best to move on. he has never stopped trying to contact me since then though. he uses fake numbers to text me and call me, yesterday he left me a voicemail, he used to email me before i blocked that too, he‚Äôs made many many instagram accounts to harass me, he posts about me etc. i talked to the same officer from last year (he‚Äôs very helpful and has always made time to answer questions for me even a year later) and his advice was to get a restraining order rather than file a harassment charge since it would be hard to prove that the fake numbers are even him.

my questions are:
is it easy to get one? 
i have that police report, i haven‚Äôt deleted any texts from the fake numbers or instagram dms, i always make it clear that the contact is unwanted, the only thing i worry about is he tries to be ‚Äúsweet‚Äù and say that he loves me, goodnight messages, etc through text. (the instagram messages are very clearly aggressive and mean) i just worry it won‚Äôt be seen as serious since all of the very recent stuff is just like ‚Äúgoodnight ily‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a blessing‚Äù i do have a message from about two years ago before we were completely done where he asked to r*pe me from his actual facebook account , this was fucked up of course and the conversation shows that i was very upset by it, it wasn‚Äôt a joke or anything it was a real request. i also worry about the fake numbers and that he can just deny that it‚Äôs him.

what is the court hearing like?
will he deny everything? do i have to go through all the evidence in front of him or will it be submitted and reviewed beforehand, i have voice messages that would have to be submitted anyways. how much will he be able to talk, will i be like questioned a lot? can i have my bf or my dad with me to make me feel safe? will he be allowed to linger afterwards? idk i would like to be prepared emotionally so pls let me know. 

i had to communicate with him for a couple weeks before i gave up about the lease. i wasn‚Äôt trying to harass him but every time i asked for an update about me getting taken off he wouldn‚Äôt tell me anything and refused to work with me on that. like i said i gave up and worked with the leasing office and police to get me off. will this affect me getting a restraining order since i did have to communicate with him over a couple weeks last year ?",TW Physical Violence

"Severely Disabled Woman Looking for Advice w/Dealing with Abuser TW:medical,emotional,physical,sexual abuse mentioned",6,"Hi, I‚Äôm (29f) looking for advice from people who were or are severely disabled who got away from their abusers or who found a way to work towards that even if it‚Äôs slow going. Examples of my limitations include: unable to walk due to fatigue and spinal issues(caused by MS), difficulty concentrating due to medications, brain fog & epilepsy, fatigue triggered by severity of abuse, MS, regular (3-4 a week) seizures, etc.)

I know a lot of people on here suggest leaving and I would if I was able to in a heartbeat, but that‚Äôs not an option for me. If I leave I will be homeless and dead shortly due to medical conditions that require expensive medications and horrifically impaired mobility. I have been homeless before and it is not something I could currently survive. Most shelters (both homeless and dv) are not equipped to be accessible regardless of ADA requirements.

I‚Äôm so tired and tired of being terrified. My husband(32m) controls my health insurance and access to doctors and medicine. I don‚Äôt currently have the ability to work from home because my conditions are not under control and the medications I‚Äôm on combined with the constant abuse leave me too exhausted to leave my bed. When I push said limits I have seizures which just make everything worse and leave me with hours to days of memory loss. If I could get a break from him and just be on my own for a few months with access to necessary medical care I think I could get stuff under control enough to get a part time job, but I have no idea how to give myself that.

His abuse mostly centers on controlling my access to food, water, my mobility aides (wheelchair/crutches), medical care (medications/doctors) and the outside world, gaslighting me, lying to me about literally anything, blaming me for anything he views in our life as being a failure. It will often tip into physical abuse (sleep restriction, pushing me to do something that he knows will trigger a seizure or fainting, food restriction, medicine restriction, denying me access to medical care (after seizures that lasted more than 5 minutes, after seizures/fainting episodes where I hit my head, after bad falls where I‚Äôve injured ligaments or tendons in my legs, etc.). He‚Äôs shoved me a few times and sexual abuse was a regular part of our relationship until I got too sick to be able to do what he wanted.

I know how horrific this all sounds and wouldn‚Äôt leaving be better? But...if I leave I stop having access to the medical care I literally need to survive. Medicaid is super broken in general, but especially where I live. Plus the requirements for getting a divorce in order for financial filing to work the way it needs to will take months; months I don‚Äôt have to miss taking my life saving drugs that cost literally thousands of dollars out of pocket every month. I‚Äôm really sorry if reading this really stressed anyone out. I know how bad it is.

I‚Äôm looking for any resources whatsoever that are geared towards disabled people trapped in abusive relationships. The stuff I‚Äôve found on google hasn‚Äôt really been for abuse victims, it‚Äôs been for people helping abuse victims or general disabled people are more likely to be abuse victims than the average person. I don‚Äôt have family (orphan no siblings) or friends (cut off over a decade ago by a husband who then moved us thousands of miles away soon after) who can help me. He has kept me isolated from basically everyone for well over 6 years using my disability as an excuse.

Any advice on websites, books, financial resources, staying safe while living with someone who has threatened to kill you, etc. would be highly appreciated. I‚Äôm looking for resources for work that I could potentially do from my bed as well or any suggestions regarding managing fatigue while in an abusive relationship. Any advice regarding dealing with the fatigue brought on by being unable to leave an abusive relationship would be amazing. ",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
A concerned sister,3,"My sister has started dating a man back in October. At first he seemed perfect but he would be ""mean"" if they fought over text but if it was in person he was nice about it. It slowly escalated into him being mean in person if they fought too. When he learned my sister had a promiscuous phase when she was 17, she is 24 now, he flipped. He called her a whore, asked how many time he had sex with her with other man's stuff in her, how many times he looked like a chump because when they walk in town all the dudes have had sex with her before and he's just her next guy and etc. I thought that was too much to put up with and nearly got my sister to end the relationship when she talked to my brother and his wife who said it was a learning process. 


This weekend he took shrooms and was pinching, punching, and yanking her hair out of her head. She had called me sobbing and screaming on the phone and I had to call the police to get her out of there. She had clumps of hair down her back, bruises all along her sides, and scratch marks down her back. To get away from him she had to take off her own shirt while running away from him because he would not let go.Two hours after that incident she talked to him on the phone and he said I love you for the first time, how he's supposed she won't break up with him, how guilty he feels, ect. She is still with him and in fact just wants to move on and hung out with him the next day. 


My wonderful sister in law was told the story and still met with him and said she liked him. I am the only one who thinks he's an abuser. At first my sister understood why I didn't want to talk to him or see him but he started sending her all these poor me messages. Saying stuff like he will never have a normal relationship with her or our family, he shouldn't go to her birthday party that's in two weeks, etc. Now my sister is mad at me and saying I'm the one who was least affected and I am preventing everything from going back to normal. I feel like I am seeing my sister fall deeper into an a abusive relationship and I don't know what to do. And through everyone around me I am questioning if he is an abuser but deep down I feel like he is. What should I do and is she in an abusive relationship?

I threw my dad out and I‚Äôm feeling guilty.,7,"Last week my dad called me from jail after he was arrested for domestic violence. He started dating someone new around Christmas and as far as I knew things were going fine. Now, my dad is the least violent guy I know so I honestly assumed she fightclubbed herself or something. But his friend bailed him out and he came over and apologized like crazy and his friend said when he went over there she couldn‚Äôt even really open her eyes. 

So this information alone kind of sent me spiraling because I left a super abusive relationship a few years ago and moved in with my mom and dad until they broke up at which point I am now living with my mom and my daughter. My dad never once showed any sign of violence that whole time  and he told me that she kept coming at him and hitting him and finally attacked him with a coffee mug which is what caused him to lose control that night. Obviously this also sent up alarm bells because ‚Äúlose control‚Äù is what most abusers say. But he‚Äôs my dad, I know him really well and I believe fully that he was pushed to it. 

So he swore up and down that he was going to kick her out when he went home and scoffed at me when I asked if he would get back together with her. He went and picked up his dog and brought him to my house and went back to his friend‚Äôs place until he could figure out how to get her out. 

So a few days go by and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhey what‚Äôs up‚Äù and he says he‚Äôs back at home he‚Äôll come get the dog in a few days and I‚Äôm like cool, he works long hours, he probably wants to get him on his day off. 

He shows up today and the first thing I ask is if she is still in the house. He says yes, but they quit drinking, so everything is fine. I tell him he needs to leave because at this point he‚Äôs CHOSEN violence. He watched me through an abusive relationship, he knows it doesn‚Äôt just stop. Whether or not he‚Äôs the abusive one, he knows he can be pushed there and that she can do it to him. He knows this will happen again and he‚Äôs just fine being that person. I can‚Äôt have a person like that in my life or my daughter‚Äôs, that‚Äôs exactly why we left her father.

awful abuse going on next door - what can we do??,10,"My boyfriend and I just moved into a new place this week, a two-family home split straight down the middle, with several roommates (who already lived here). Tonight around 6 p.m., my boyfriend and I heard respectively, ‚Äúcan anyone hear me‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù, but somewhat muffled and neither of us could tell where it was coming from or whether we heard it correctly. There was a ton of screaming so my boyfriend ran outside but no one was there and after that we didn‚Äôt hear anything else. We had no way of knowing where it was coming from and if we heard correctly, and this would be a terrible neighborhood to bring police into on vague accusations of harm. We decided to keep an eye and ear out for anything else - I‚Äôm not sure if we made a mistake here. 

Around 1:30 tonight we heard two women arguing, mostly what sounded like the woman from earlier. Lot‚Äôs of screaming. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fucking murder you!‚Äù, and it really sounded like the woman who screamed around 6, but we don‚Äôt want to say we‚Äôre certain.

I heard a man‚Äôs voice - not yelling, so not distinct enough to know what he said - and some more movement and nothing since then.

I‚Äôm very frightened but also very confused about what is even going on here - what should we do? We didn‚Äôt know it was coming from next door earlier, and of course we cannot and would not just ignore this - but I‚Äôm terrified of endangering anyone‚Äôs safety by involving the police.

It happened again after years,1,"My brother (m30) hit my (f20) mother (f60) during an argument. This has not occured in years. 

My brother has been diagnosed with depression, but before he accepted to go to a doctor, he caused a lot of trouble. Ever since I was 12, I remember him having major anger management issues and my mother was often caught in the middle of it. He never did anything physical to me (except once where we fought for a while).

He has been on medication and visiting a doc for a couple of years and things have been kinda calm. But still, I am to this day so scared of him. I constantly have in mind that the smallest thing could trigger him.

And so, last Saturday, my mother was in a mood and was making comments about him (he could obviously hear her)  That was when he lost it. They began fighting and last thing I knew he was hitting her. I was in my room, didn't know what to do. I was so terrified, all the horrible memories were coming back to me and I froze completely.

I don't know what to do. I'm really scared, I can't sleep because of this. My mother just won't back down either, she keeps provoking him.

Ex abuser and his multiple FB accounts. Why??,4,"I've been posting updates here about my progress. I kicked my abuser out 2 months ago. We had some contact up until a week after which he played various mind games to make me feel worthless and like he was dumping me, even though it was the other way around. I blocked him and he has remained blocked since January. (A week after he moved out) my life has improved so much. He has gone eerie quiet, but he has not blocked me and also has multiple FB accounts with his name and picture. I've blocked them all. I'm wondering if he has been keeping tabs on me that way, while blocked on his main account. I blocked the extra accounts today as I only just found out. He does also stalk his child's mother, but it makes no sense to have that many accounts. I also found one he made a month before I kicked him out with his full name and photo (blocked that today too) and idk why on earth he made that for. It was december so probably to contact child's mother. I don't want anything to do with him anymore and I've been seeing a new guy too, who took photos of us last night, which I wanted to upload until I realised all of ex's current accounts.

Too afraid to Sleep for Fear that my Husband will Come Back and Hurt us,5,"I‚Äôve been married since 1/25/17 but we‚Äôve been together since February 2014. We are both addicts and we‚Äôre both in recovery but he relapsed... I‚Äôve been clean since 10/24/11...
He started using again in 2018 and then went to jail, then rehab then got out and every thing was kosher until around January of 2020. He started dabbling again and then when lockdown happened here (US) last March he went off the deep end. Using heroin, fentanyl, crack, amphetamines and is now in a methadone program. I made him leave a while ago bc it was getting too out of control... I was still visiting with him and spending time with him and the kids as a family a few days a week... he came over Sunday after work while I was grocery shopping with the kids bc we planned on going for a nice walk, making dinner and then watching a movie. I knew right away that he wasn‚Äôt right. After trying to avoid confrontation I finally said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôve used and you can‚Äôt be here‚Äù... that was it. He went psycho! He took my wallet after destroying the house and saying the most foul things to myself and the girls (7 and 5. 5 year old is his, 7 year old he has raised since she was 5 months old). I got upset and started crying and fussing about wanting my money back and him leaving and he threw me through the dining room so I ran outside and screamed for help bc he was about to start beating me. The neighbor intervened and then him, 2 other neighbors and my 7 yr old all called 911. He was gone by the time they got here but bc of the nature of the calls and all of the witnesses they charged him with 2nd degree assault/DV. He came back to get stuff that he left laying outside and then came barging into the house and screaming, being violent towards me and screaming at the kids and the cats. He tried to slap my phone away from me (had my BFF on speaker phone) and wound up slapping me, HARD... told me he was going to kill me, I‚Äôm a fucking whore, told my 7 year old that she‚Äôs a bastard and to go fuck herself, etc... then he got back into the car reversed super aggressively and then sped towards my car like he was going to hit it, twice... then he floored it out of there. The neighbor called the cops as soon as she heard his car (exhaust leak makes it loud) but again the cops just missed him. 

I packed the kids into the car at 11:15 and drove to the commissioner‚Äôs office to file a protective order. They granted it immediately especially since the trooper gave me a case number for the charges he putting on him. 

I‚Äôm just like, in shock, terrified, incredibly sad for these 2 sweet girls... there have been times where he got violent with me like 3 or 4 other times in the 7 years we‚Äôve cohabitated together but nothing like what happened just hours ago... I need to be back at the courthouse by 10 AM for the hearing to extend my PO for a week and then I‚Äôll go back in a week to finalize it for a year. I‚Äôm following through and doing what needs to be done. 
This chapter of my life and my kid‚Äôs lives will be closed soon but the long term effects will be ever lasting and permanent...

My best friend's brother is hitting her and her parents don't care,2,"My best friend who's around 19 has a very abusive younger brother. He's about 16-17. He's very heavy and is strong, unfortunately.

He is sexist as proven by many things he says to her, and violent.

Today it went too far, as a very pretty argument broke.

He grabbed her and pushed her down on her bed, managing to pin her down and grabbing her arms hard.
After which he choked her by her neck.

My friend keeps telling her mom about it, but her mom doesn't do anything. Her brother is their parents favorite, so they spoil him rotten.

He has gotten violent with her before, but not to this extent.

What can she do? I really want to help her

My girlfriend abuses me but I don't know if I deserve it or not.,6,"My girlfriend has been very abusive to me. Punching, scratching, whipping me with TV cords and other items. Throwing glass objects and leaving me to pick them up. I feel like I deserve this though because we had a threesome that she says traumatized her and that I made her do all these things. I need some help from a non biased person.",TW Physical Violence
My story and finding out I have siblings,2,"I was roughly 4 when most of this took place.

My first memory is me looking up from under the kitchen table to see him pinning my mom to the wall with a knife to her throat. 

I rushed out and pushed him screaming stop it! Then immediately ran into my room to hide in the closet. I started crying hysterically and shaking because I knew what was going to happen next.

He rips the door open, grabs one of my arms, drags me out and slaps me over and over screaming insults about my mom about how big of a whore she is and she deserves this.

I ended up getting 2 black eyes from that and an assortment of other bruises.

One night I walked in on him having sex with my mom. At the time I didn't know this was rape and I didn't realize it until I was older. I just knew that she was crying fairly hard and while her crying was unfortunately a very common occurrence it sounded worse than ""normal"".

In daily life he was extremely controlling of her. She had to tell him where she was going to go, how long she'd be out, and he'd have to approve of it, if she went shopping she had to show him the receipt to prove that she was there and not out being a whore. Everytime she was leaving he'd tell her that if she told anyone about the abuse he'd take me away and she'd never see me again. 

Sometime before I was born he killed her puppy because it was distracting her from doing her wifely duties. She did something wrong at some point and he decided to throw her on the bed, pull out his gun, put it right next to her head and shoot into the mattress several times. 

My mom had several jobs and this piece of excrement wasn't working for whatever reason. 

So when it was time for her to work in the evening I was left alone with him for extended periods of time. Which she really didn't want to do but she didn't have much of a choice. 

His abuse was worse when she wasn't there. Make a noise? Tabasco on my tongue. If cried because I missed my mom? Slapping me over and over yelling at me to stop. 

He had this habit of drinking himself to sleep and crawling in bed with me where he proceeds to piss himself. I silently sobbed and tried to not disturb him by hyperventilating. 

My mom would take care of my great grandmother (she was in her 90s) on the weekends, which was shopping for food, housecleaning, bathing her etc. So it would take pretty much all day.

We got home relatively late one day and tried to open the front door and it wouldn't budge, so we went to the back door instead only now we heard some loud hammering coming from inside. My mom knocked, he rips the door open and we see that he has it chain locked so we can't get inside. He says he's boarding up all of the doors and windows. 

He starts hurling insults at my mom and she starts to cry and says it's ok if he kicks her out she just needs to get my medicine (I was sick at the time). He gets it and shoves it into my mom's hands and tells us to leave. My mom sends me upstairs (we lived in whatever the hell the word for a 3 person duplex is) to see my mom's friend who knew the situation and tells me to stay there until she comes to get me.

Now I wasn't aware of this until 15 years later but when she talked him into letting her back he berated her and she just kind of stood in disbelief at how fucked the apartment was. There was cut fabric (all of my mom's clothes), broken pieces of the native american things she had collected over the years, and slashed open all of the couch cushions and their matress. 

She told him that he needed to stop drinking and he slapped her and she proceeded to walk out. 

He yelled out his usual I'm going to take him away from you and you'll never see him again!

She came and got me and we ended up staying at her best friends house and her 2 kids for awhile.

After school one day he came and picked me up and said we were going to see a movie. The next thing I remember after that was being in the back of a police car with him passed out from drinking. Since he was unconscious the police asked if I knew a phone number they could call to let them know what was going on.

My mom drilled my grandparents number into my head as a just in case. They were called and came to get me. As for him though, he was put in jail for I don't know how long. 

It was awhile before he got out but when he was released he found out where we were staying and came over to plead and convince my mom to come back. She said she needed a day or so to pack and he told her that was fine and that he was sober so nothing like that will happen again. 

The following day my mom called the police and they escorted her and myself to our apartment to grab whatever belongings we still had left there.

He was in shock and got really angry, said that he loves her, and he's changed and don't do this and other desperate generic things. Her response was that it was too late for sorry and she never wanted to see him again. She then walked into the kitchen, opened the cabinet and pulled out a decent amount of money from underneath some plates. 

She told me later that she left it there because he refused to do anything in the kitchen because that was women's work. 

He had a shocked look on his face and it quickly turned into anger.

Things were getting heated and the cops took her into another room to have them both cool off. 

So I was left alone with him. 

He grabbed my shoulders and I tensed up immediately and felt the tears welling up. He told me to take care of my mom and that he loves us more than anything. I was sobbing and struggling to pull away from him and one of the cops walked in and saw him and told him to back off.

His response was I was just saying goodbye to my son.

The police told him that if he did anything else to us he's be going back to jail. We left right after that.

We moved in with my grandparents house for awhile after that. Whenever she left the house for whatever reason I would immediately start crying and hyperventilating for fear of him coming to get me. My grandparents assured me that I was safe but I didn't believe them. 

Then the nightmares started. I'd dream of him taking me away and/or beating my mom and me and it was all mixed in with some weird Chuckie (Child's Play) and Crypt Keeper visuals (My mom's friend who lived upstairs from us loved watching horror movies and thought it was a brilliant idea to watch a movie about a homicidal doll with a 4 year old). I'd wake up in a cold sweat and start crying. My mom would just hug me and say that everything was going to be alright.

They eventually got a divorce and she was granted full custody and  he was only allowed to see me when my mom approved it. Which was only ever once and I'm pretty sure it was only because he wanted his TV back. 

My mom told me later that she was terrified of him leaving with me but went along with it anyway because her then boyfriend now husband assured her that it wasn't going to happen. At some point he tracked him down and I'm assuming he gave some kind of violent threat, but she doesn't know what was said exactly. 

Anyway he also wasn't allowed to know where we lived. Although one day not too long after the divorce I was outside in the front yard watching cars go by when this white truck slows down and stares at me. It was him. I ran as fast as I could back into the house and started crying thinking he was going to come and get me. 

Fortunately that never happened and I don't think he 100% thought it was me. I found out years later from one of the neighbors that he was there to interview for a job with his landscaping business. They ended up not hiring him and he gave up on the job search in Michigan and moved to Oklahoma. I think that was because of my Dad (her new husband) but I can't say for sure. 

When he got there he tried to buy himself a house but his credit was garbage so he did the next best thing: use mine. I didn't find this out until I went to apply for a car loan some 18 years later. 

At some point in middle school, roughly 5 or 6 years after seeing him last, I got home and my mom sat me down and told me that he had died. He overdosed on some kind of drug that I can't recall. They ruled it as an accidental suicide. 

I don't think she was too surprised by my reaction. When I told her I was apathetic she told me that it would be ok if I were even a little sad, he was my ""father"" after all. I told her nope, not going to happen. He got what he deserve and I hope he's rotting in hell.

Fast forward 20ish years and I find out that I have 4 siblings from him. All with different mothers. 

The youngest one reached out to me last year and asked me if he was my father. She gave me some pretty specific details about him, so I knew she was telling truth. This post is the first time I've ever put anything about me and him with this much detail on the internet. 

I haven't responded to her yet (it's been 30 weeks according to FB messenger). Part of me wants to but the other part wants nothing to do with anyone remotely associated with him. For all I know she hates him as much as I do, but what if she doesn't? I have such a deep seething hatred for the man that I'm not sure how'd I'd react to her, or anyone really, telling me positive things about him. 

Does anyone have an opinion on that situation?

I've been thinking about this a lot lately and it feels so good to talk about this. Even through text. 

Thank you for reading.

I've done my best to make this as coherent as I can. And it's possible that I got the order wrong in some of these events since I was very young and I don't like to talk to my mom about it.

Husband laughed at a comic about strangulation,23,"So last night my husband was reading Calvin and Hobbes (which is great) to our daughter. They were reading for a while (which is great) but nothing was ""haha"" funny, just kind of funny. Then he got to this part where the mom says something like ""if it weren't for \_\_\_\_ I'd be choking you right now"" and my husband laughs about it.

The problem is about 10 years ago he strangled me and left bruises on my neck and face and chest and I was in pain for months every time I even swallowed water. Last night was perfect other than that. I didn't want to spoil the evening so I said nothing even though I found it very triggering and kind of bizzare on his part as I've explained to him that he can't make jokes about strangling people (he used to) since he HAS STRANGLED ME.

AITA for being so upset about it? And now it's the weekend and I don't want to wreck our weekend by saying something (he's a narcissist and so calling him on this would mean he's probably verbally abuse me and blame me for wrecking the weekend for all of us etc., it would mean a big fight).

&#x200B;

UPDATE: On Sunday night, so that I wouldn't ""ruin the weekend"" I calmly brought up that I due to what has happened between us I am not comfortable with how he laughed at a comic where Calvin's mom threatens to strangle him. He ""what do you mean what happened?"" I said ""when you strangled me."" He said ""that was 10 years ago, I haven't thought about it since then."" I said ""well, I have because it happened to me."" he then went on to say he didn't strangle me because I could breathe and he was just holding me down so I wouldn't get up and yell and I replied that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't scream and that he left bruises all over my chin, jaw, neck and chest and couldn't swallow without being in pain for about  and he said ""you never had bruises"" and I said yes I did, and that that is called strangulation and months, then that went on for a little bit but eventually he did admit that that is strangulation and that that was a horrible thing to do and that it did happen and that he did do that. He then said he doesn't/hasn't laughed at people being strangled because that's not funny and he's not a sociopath. Then I reminded him that he came home from school one day and told me that this woman in his program was super annoying and that he was making jokes to his cohort that he was going to strangle her (and told me that and laughed about it) that at that time I told him I was not comfortable with him making strangulation jokes as HE HAS STRANGLED ME, and he said we never had that conversation (we did have that conversation)  but eventually he let that go and just kept saying he's never laughed at anything like that. I reminded him that he laughed when a character on the show Barry got strangled and on the show Homeland one of the characters strangles someone and he laughed again and he said I was being weird in bringing stuff like that up. I said it's not weird, it happened, and he replied that I'm strangely trying to keep track of stuff to be upset about so I replied that I'm not keeping track, I remember those instances because they were very jarring and difficult for me. He said he would never do something like that (he did). BUT WHATEVER.  I said fine, whatever, maybe I've misinterpreted, but we will never have to talk about this again if for as long as I live as long as he never laughs or takes lightly anything having to do with strangulation. He said fine, and that he got it. Then later he says to me that I have been holding a grudge. I said I am not holding a grudge, that this is a matter of personal safety, and what I feel isn't anger, it's concern for myself. I said he's a great husband otherwise, but I need him to be sensitive around this issue.

It seems we had a very productive, honest, good discussion and I feel the matter is settled. I actually feel really good about his responses. There was push back and denial and just blatant lack of memory (this is an issue in our relationship) but overall I think he gets it and will be respectful moving forward. He said he would be. I feel he was being honest and that there was a spirit of contrition in his reactions (after all the initial denials lol).

"I called CPS for my sister‚Äôs kids, and I don‚Äôt know what to do next",14,"I‚Äôm conflicted about reporting my sister‚Äôs situation to CPS, and I‚Äôd appreciate another perspective and advice on what to do next.

Background: my younger sister, Sarah*, has been with her husband, Jason*, for ~ 20 years. He is 10+ years older than she is, and she was a teenager when they met. Our family has never liked Jason, but we‚Äôve tried to keep the peace for my sister and fear of alienating her. We saw the abusive behaviors starting to emerge when they were dating: poisoning her against us and isolating her from us and friends, control, etc. We knew it had to be her choice to leave him, so we tried to stay in her life as best we could.

In addition to the age gap when they met, Jason‚Äôs criminal history bothered us. In separate incidents, he had been convicted of possession of a firearm without a permit, disorderly conduct, furnishing alcohol to minors, and two separate incidents of assault (against two previous girlfriends). We didn‚Äôt know the extent of it when they married, but we did know about a felony kidnapping conviction (also an ex-girlfriend), for which he served time, and he said wasn‚Äôt his fault, and the whole world is against him ‚Äî as usual. He‚Äôd also had dismissed charges of trespassing, disorderly conduct, burglary, and interference with a 911 call as part of the convictions above.

Shortly after they married, Sarah and Jason moved back to Jason‚Äôs hometown in another state, and they have three young children. I never visited them in all this time because Jason and I especially don‚Äôt get along, but my parents and other siblings made regular visits, and Sarah also started visiting my parents more, too, when she could with the kids, which might be once every 1-2 years. Jason has always been a deadbeat, never keeping steady employment in their entire relationship, while Sarah works two and three jobs to pay their bills. (He keeps up his delusions that he‚Äôs going to be a pro-league sports coach someday.) He is also an abusive father; between the physical abuse (which we only just now confirmed from the kids), the emotional abuse, and his toxic masculinity, he‚Äôs a grade A a-hole.

Now, the new story: last fall, my parents got a call in the middle of the night that Jason assaulted Sarah and their eldest child. (By assault, I mean nearly beat to death.) He was arrested and held in jail per their state‚Äôs statutes. Of course, my parents immediately went up there, and Sarah was finally ready to leave. (We had suspected physical abuse for a long time, but like most, she keeps secrets.) Because it was a domestic assault, CPS got involved and told her that if she went back to him, she would lose the children. Our family and friends all rallied, from taking care of all the legal stuff so she could leave the state before he was released, to installing security at my parents‚Äô house before they returned, to getting the kids in school and therapy when she arrived, to even finding her a job when she was ready. They have been living with my parents since, who are also providing their primary financial support. With COVID and their trauma, it‚Äôs been a rough time, but we have been optimistic. She filed for divorce, and we were finally seeing some of our former sister return.

Jason was charged with two counts of assault and one for preventing a 911 call. When Jason was arraigned, the criminal court issued strict no contact orders. He immediately filed to have online visitation with their two younger children, which the court permitted with supervision. However, the court-appointed guardian ad litem petitioned to be removed from the case since the kids are out of state, and the court allowed Sarah to supervise the twice-weekly calls. 

This is where things start to fall apart. He used those calls to basically talk to my sister, and the manipulation game began again. He started breaking the court orders in other ways, too: closing their bank accounts, changing passwords to online bills, and sending the kids gifts. He finally made a big production (via social media) about going to rehab, which we found to be  some fake ‚Äúpoor me‚Äù camp, for a few weeks.

When he was discharged from there, things really started to escalate. Sarah started becoming even more secretive, and what little we did learn from what she shared about their divorce proceedings seemed like really, really bad advice. (We later found out via photos from an acquaintance that her divorce attorney was caught fraternizing with Jason at an event.) Jason was also calling and texting at all hours, and when we pressed her about the no contact orders, she said they filed to have them revised, and this was all authorized. We know it‚Äôs important to let DV survivors have control and not to issue ultimatums, so we took her at her word. Jason had gotten a job (for a few weeks, before he was fired) and was sending her money, which was a major issue in their marriage, and she said she was only interacting with him because of that. She also stopped the kids‚Äô and her own therapy, which we hadn‚Äôt realized.

Big mistake. Our alarm bells started screaming when we found out Jason was coming to my parents‚Äô town to visit the kids, and they would all be staying in a hotel. Sarah said this was all okay, but we smelled something rotten. We did our own research and called the court and attorneys in both states, and we learned the no-contact orders had NEVER been revised, and so he had been breaking them this entire time and Sarah was lying to us about it. By the time we confirmed all of this, he had left, and so our local CPS and police department said there was nothing they could do if he was no longer physically there since the case originated in another state. So we started documenting as much as we could and have been waiting these last few weeks.

However, this all came to a head these last few days. Sarah said she was taking the kids to see Jason and his parents in their hometown for spring break. We knew the no-contact orders prohibited this, so we finally confronted her with it the day before, and she LOST HER MIND, accusing of some some ‚Äúagenda‚Äù and how we‚Äôre controlling her, etc. We know this is just his manipulation of her, so we didn‚Äôt engage in the fight she was starting, and she left mad with the kids. We hadn‚Äôt heard from her since.

We have been sick with worry the last few days about the kids and their safety, so I called their local CPS office and asked for a wellness check on the kids. They had the whole backstory already, and by the end of the day, they had notified police and had Jason arrested yesterday. He‚Äôs currently sitting in jail waiting to be arraigned, and the prosecutor let us know this will be in addition to the criminal charges already pending in the original incident from last year. He said Sarah was uncooperative, and he absolutely sees what‚Äôs happening re: Jason‚Äôs manipulation; he indicated that, if he has to, he‚Äôs prepared to put their eldest child on the stand to testify.

Sarah still has the kids for now (that we know of), although we‚Äôre expecting and prepared for CPS to remove them, at least temporarily. We‚Äôre worried they‚Äôre going to give them to HIS family, who have enabled Jason in everything, and we‚Äôll never see them again. She is furious with us ‚Äî especially me, since I called CPS ‚Äî and says we‚Äôll never talk to them again, we‚Äôre the ones who went around the system (not her), and all the textbook abuse-speak Jason has poured into her for 20 years. She also says we‚Äôre hypocrites for having a relationship with our parents. (Our dad had a drinking problem when we were growing up, and he‚Äôs been sober for almost 20 years. Our other siblings and I have also had a lot of therapy and conversations between us and with our parents, so we are in a much better place and have the relationships and boundaries with each other we need. And we‚Äôve all worked damn hard to make sure we don‚Äôt repeat the cycle with our own spouses and kids. Sarah doesn‚Äôt see all of that because she‚Äôs lived in another state. She left, married this loser, and has been living in a dysfunctional family her entire life. She doesn‚Äôt know the difference.)

We know she‚Äôs humiliated, ashamed, angry, and terrified, so our family is still mostly unified and can handle what she‚Äôs throwing at us (not taking it personally). We see how she got to where she is, and we‚Äôre sad and still love her and would welcome her back with open arms when she‚Äôs ready to be done with him. But she‚Äôs not there, and we have NO IDEA what to do next. We don‚Äôt even know if she‚Äôs returning with the kids when school starts next week.

Were we right to call CPS? Should I have waited til the kids were back with my parents? We know we did the right things for the kids, but did we do the right thing for Sarah? WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!

TL;DR ‚Äî I reported my sister to CPS, and they had her husband arrested and will be removing the kids from her care. We‚Äôre worried we‚Äôll never see the kids or my sister again. What should we do?

Update: we have tried talking to the social worker at CPS today, and they won‚Äôt even tell us where Sarah or the kids are, who even has the kids, or if they‚Äôre okay, citing HIPPA. Is there anything else we can do?",TW Physical Violence
He made me watch,21,"I feel so incredibly trapped.

Two weeks ago I had an abortion and the day after I expressed I was upset he didnt ask how i was. He started the verbal abuse and its hard to remember what I had done so wrong. But I was in the shower and i said i wanted to leave. He put the shower head in my mouth and choked me after with his hands. He beat the sink with my hair dryer and cracked the porcelain. He needed to go another town and he calmed on the ride. Then I saw him texting his ex and idk I said that I knew it. We were in a woodsy area when no one around. He pushed my head to the center console and proceeded to punch the back of my neck. Almost home he said that when we get home he used to be the s*** out of me. I begged and pleaded that I would literally do anything. I fantasize about taking my pet and running to the nearest store. My car doesn't work and I didn't have a phone at the time. When we got home I took a shower again because Im only safe to cry there. I heard my pet crying. I got out of the shower to dry off and he brought my pet limp. He then held the back of my neck and made me watch punching my pet. he said that this was my fault. He grabbed a plastic bag and put it over his face. I disassociated because I believe that he was going to die. He threw him back in the cage and we went to bed. I had to pee and checked on him hurt but alive. That morning he was stiff. He made me put him in a bag and put him in the ground. His little toe was broken. I'm so scared I really don't know how to get out of this.

I told him everything and he told me to report him but I'm really scared and I don't know what to do.

I want to save my mother from being hurt again,2,"My brother and I came home today from an errand to find my mom crying in the bathroom with a red spot on her forehead.  She then told me that my dad hit her with his phone and even tried to throw a glass cup at her as well.  I'm assuming he threw it very hard because there's a hole in the wall and there were shards everywhere.  This abuse has happened since before I was born.  However, I'm old enough now to realize this is not right and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.  The problem is, we did not call the police.  I was stunned and could not move or do anything when she told me.  This is exactly how I would react when I was younger.  I don't know why I always freeze in fear.  

How can I help my mother? I have tried to convince her to divorce him but I don't want him to try and harm her again.  My mother said that my dad has threatened to hurt her if she ""puts my brother and I against him."" I feel guilty for not doing anything in the moment this all occured.

"Struggling with PTSD, looking for a treatment facility equipped to handle various DV related issues.",8,"Backstory: I (31 F) was diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist in 2018 after the first major physical and sexual assault occurred in a relationship which ultimately lasted a total of ~5 years. Since the abuse began, I have been living a constant cycle of leaving, missing him, reconciling, honeymoon period, escalating abuse, calling police, restraining order/legal involvement and repeat. To complicate things, I began to struggle with substance use alongside my abuser (37 M). He would enter into several treatment programs alone, and although I desperately wanted to, he would not let me go get help without him and ended up admitting with me to treatment. He got upset with the staff and told me we were leaving after 5 days.

By October 2020, the frequency and severity of abuse reached a new level, I hadn't worked in a year, was an all day/daily user and was so isolated that the only person I had contact with was my abuser. In a single moment of clarity, I decided to give life one more try. I left, went to detox and immediately drove ""home"" to another state I had left 10 years prior to start over. My abuser was arrested within a week of my departure. 

Now: I am working again at an amazing job in my career field, I am physically safe, have my own place. But I am not OK. My ex was released from jail in February, and since then, I have been spiraling and have reached out to him despite a restraining order and a no-contact order and him being on probation for 5 years for the assault (multiple offenses). I know I don't want to see him and I don't want to reconcile.

I have been on a waiting list for therapy with a local DV organization for four months. I have reached out to every crisis line, and several other organizations. I have health insurance and have reached out to therapists in the area who continuously refer me to the organizations I already reached out to or another therapist who refers me elsewhere. My symptoms are out of control, I'm starting to isolate, I have used, and I am not taking good care of myself. I don't want to do this again. I need to go somewhere safe and get better.

My question: does anyone know of or have first-hand experience with treatment centers equipped to handle DV issues, trauma, substance abuse and PTSD? I have good health insurance and the ability to take personal time off. I want to get better and move on for good. I have Googled endlessly with no real luck.

"Pregnant and married, but I want my husband to be there for the birth of our child",23,"My husband and I haven‚Äôt had the best time during my pregnancy. I‚Äôm 30 weeks pregnant and haven‚Äôt been able to let me husband back in the home for a week because of a restraining order. I want him to be there for the birth of our child in 9 weeks, I also want him around but my family is trying to keep him away from me and I‚Äôm still having anxiety attacks daily over the whole situation. 

A few months ago I confronted my husband over where our money from our savings had went. He choked me in the hallway next to our bedroom during an argument about me wanting to know what happened to it and him saying it was none of my business and I‚Äôm crazy. He also broke my laptop and iPad a few days prior and I‚Äôm a graphic designer and we don‚Äôt have much savings anymore because of the pandemic we‚Äôre very strapped for cash right now and couldn‚Äôt replace them. 

Last week we were in an argument because I wanted him to stop smoking so much weed and he called me annoying and said I need to be submissive.  Then he threw my wedding band out the window. And two days after that I was out on a two mile walk with the dog and when I got back he was in a mood and ended up hitting me several times as hard as he could in my right arm and biting me. I was so upset I called the police and now I regret it.

He suffers from PTSD and I have been trying to get him to go get treatment for it and his anger problems because 95% of the time he‚Äôs amazing. Romantic, nurturing, loving and helpful. He does things for me all the time without me asking. He‚Äôs the perfect partner 95% of the time. But being locked up together and both of us having difficulties during Covid lockdown has made us argue more then ever. 

Currently there‚Äôs a restraining order and he can‚Äôt be around me until we can change that. But the court doesn‚Äôt want to make changes until the next court date. I need that to stop now. 

Here‚Äôs my other problem. Because I went to the hospital that day my parents are extremely worried and because they are both retired they have been taking turns driving the two hour trip to where I live to keep me company. It hasn‚Äôt been that bad but I really miss my husband. 

I‚Äôm having extreme feelings of anxiety everyday and have attacks where I have trouble breathing and start crying uncontrollably. My family is almost forcing me to give up on my marriage because of all of this and I‚Äôm not ready to. Because my father was a judge for over 30 years he‚Äôs delt with many many cases and keeps telling me it‚Äôs going to keep escalating until I‚Äôm dead or my son is hurt. He thinks my husband can‚Äôt change in enough time for the birth of my son and is doing a good job of talking to me about everything during this time. I tell him honestly how I feel and he explains to me that everything I‚Äôm feeling is normal and a lot of women go through this but he‚Äôs convinced my husband will always be an abuser. 

Help. What do I do here. I love my husband... I love my son. I want to have a family with them but I also don‚Äôt want to be hurt anymore. When do I know if he‚Äôs had enough counseling?",TW Physical Violence
I'm scared of him during arguments but he said he would never hit me,22,"This post is going to be long because I'm explaining in details so sorry in advance

I'm a 20 years old girl and my boyfriend is 21. We've been together for 7 months now. We've practically moved together (he's always at my flat)

The first 3/4 months we didn't have big arguments, except one time and he yelled at me but that's all. 

But then every time he would get mad he would punch a wall or anything else(like a pillow)near me. He would push me or block me if i tried to leave the room. There's times when he says ""i'm going to slap you"" but never did.

He sometimes raises his hand like he's going to do it but stop near my face. If i cry or stop talking he would realize and apologize.

There's that time when it was getting really heated, I insulted him so he grabbed me by the back of my neck and made me walk into the bedroom then threw me on the bed. I started crying because it was the first time it got /that/ violent and I got scared to get hit. He immediatly hugged me and said ""i would never slap you"" ""you would lose your head if I did"" then he said sorry. 

Once I was mocking him(it was in a kind way, we always tease each other it's like a game, for the context he was watching a movie very boring to me and i was like ""oh god whats going to happen next im so tensed"") so he walked to me and pulled my hair then say ""im not  annoying you right now right?"" Then pulled more. ""So leave me the **** alone"" he didnt let go until i said stop it a few times.

When he's pissed(not mad just annoyed) he punches me or bites me on my arms or legs, I told him to stop but he keeps doing it. I doesnt know if he does it for fun or not

He talks and acts like he hates domestic violence and abusers, I do really believe that he only considers punching and slapping on the face as abuse and that he doesnt realize that what he does is also a form of violence 

Many people won't understand but I do not want to leave him, I believe him when he says that he would never hit me in the face.

But how do I make him understand that what he does isn't correct etheir ?",TW Physical Violence
Should I disconnect from my family?,3,"Hello, this is my first attempt at writing a post in this subreddit. The subreddirlt I had recommended this one instead to post it in. Ive read alot of stuff about family and I want to see if I'm missing something here. Yesterday something tragic happened that reconfirmed my decision to disconnect from them.

Yesterday march 15th around 1:30pm my younger  brother(22) shot up my house with my retired military/mechanic father(67) and lil sister(24) who works from home. I was at work at the time. He was high on drug we suspect LSD(won't know until the report comes back) he screamed he is God and that he will kill himself and be resurrected 3 days later- the whole religious shitload . He was disarmed by my dad after firing bullets in the house he left and ran next door and attacked our single mother neighbor and destroyed her property. Police came and was bakeracted. 

My brother has been having issues for awhile that my father chose to ignore. The blatant lying my brother has done to him and my constant warning to get him evaluated or kick him out of the house was ignored as a ""siblings argument"". I was the first to find out he had a child of 6 years but my brother got upset and lied he didn't have one. I was the first to know he was lying that he was getting a gun due to his job again he lied (he was working at a company I previously worked at that had a strict policy on whose allowed guns or not) I have footage of him at home acting crazy the day of the event. As well as previous video of him weeks prior practicing shooting with the same gun he used and bought from our father in our backyard where everyone can see him.  He wrecked my dad's car the night prior that's still in my name. 

My father never was the type to do what a parent is supposed to do. It's his only son while also being the youngest of five. So he chose to allow it to manifest into what happened today.  He let him continue down this path while putting all of us in danger. 

My brother hates me the most simple because every lie he made I saw through it. I called him out everytime and nothing happened because the whole family chaulked it up my being childish and complaining. That I have to be the bigger person-the adult. while you let your son live alternate life that finally caught up to him. He lived rent free or barely paying for anything. He gave us all digusting looks of hatred not grasping that he lived with US. No one was forcing him to stay. Again my father ignored it all.  My neighbor told me(such a sweet person) that during the ordeal he said my name and wanted to kill me. I have no doubt that I would have been the first to be shot. 

My brother had a near death experience last March and been on a religious kick due to it. It seems he was getting better. Only for it to morph 4 months in. He started screaming the ""devil get off me"" in the middle of the night, sending religious text messages of doomsday etc.im not shaming religion but the use of it is laughable because my father thought it was helping his son. 

My father got lucky with his daughters he applied the same principal of ""ignoring it and it'll work out"" to his son. And look where it got us. My father, though he was present in our  lives and married with our mother, He also didn't like to put effort in raising us. The first two daughters fucked up, but more in a stereotypical way young teens do. My little sister is the same way like our father, complacent ignores everything and live life day to day. I'm the only one who has made a effort in my life to make.a better one and is soon 2 weeks going to train before officially moving states away to work a comfortable job.  He constantly wants to boast about me as though he had a part in it. He didn't. He didn't even know about the job 2 years into the application process. It's the only accomplishment he has to his children. I refuse to let him use it. 

The whole family is the type to laugh situations off(it's the way they cope) but I refused to make the situation funny. I stood in silence for 5 hours as the investigation happened. My older sister even sense that I wasn't gonna let this slide and left. My father refuses to accept what happened. On camera, I saw my father drop his shotgun because he couldn't shoot that psycho, I saw that, in a moment of clarity he realized the monster that was created. And he was torn between what needed to be done and 'love' all the while the neighbor is being attacked. 

My uncle called and said that my brother had sent crazy religious stuff and was asking for money. And no one said anything. I can't anymore. I'm not going to stay and be the strength of the family. Like all them are saying.  I'm tired. How can you be strength when no one wants to listen? I could have came home to a house full of dead bodies. I could have came home early and been shot. I'm tired of sacrificing myself for the sake of family who even after the ordeal that took place we're still trying to ignore the problems and say that it was luck that saved him.

  My father says that he will no longer be allowed in the house. But as he said it wasn't convinced. Hes always been the type to forgive and forget the moment one if his kids says sorry. No questions asked. And with attempted murder and assault now on his record, my father still has that same principle..he would forgive my brother the moment he apologises and allowe that piece of shit back home. 

Just like everything thing else I was right about I'm right about this. So I decided to cut ties with my family in particular my father and brother. Once I leave for training I'm not gonna be the financial bearer for him or assist in anything related to it. My lil sister I told her she can always move with me if it comes to it. But she is also like my dad I can only offer her a way out. I taking the license plate off the car I gave my dad so he can't drive it until he registers it in his name. I paid my portion of the bills for the last month that I'll be home. When I said this I was gaslighted and placed as a selfish human being and that god doesn't like that.  Then well God can a have a talk with me about it when I die. But I personally think he'll understand. 

Tl:dr- psycho brother shot up home and endangered the family. Family isn't taking it seriously. I leaving them for good to fend for themselves. Should I disconnect? 

Also: my brother is only called my brother for the sake of the post. I have officially disowned him as my family.

Just realising I (m) have been abused mentally the past 13 years,28,"Hi Everybody, I need to get this off of my chest.

I have been married to my wife for 4 years. We have been together for a little over 13 years (I was 16 she was 18).

We went to the same class before and she never really was a person I liked but when puberty hit and she started to show interest in me, things started to change. We started to see each other more often and started kissing and she was getting me off with her hand but did not want to have sex without a relationship. 
I was starting to lose interest because I did not love her and didn‚Äôt want to ask her to be my gf just to get sex. I should‚Äôve sticked with that plan and not let myself be convinced by a friend to make her my gf (obviously for sex) because that relationship turned out to ruin my life for the following 13 years.

I was a very extroverted person with a lot of male and female friends and was talking and writing with them regularly.
Right from the start she was very jealous and did not want me to have contact with other girls. Instead of setting borders to her I told her that if she wanted me to do that, I would not let her have any contact to any of her male friends too. 
I honestly don‚Äôt know why I did that...somehow I felt bad doing things that would hurt her and therefore those things felt ‚Äúforbidden‚Äú to me....like having contact with other girls..she convinced me that a man with a girlfriend shouldn‚Äôt have contact to other girls. It seemed logical at that time to me which may have to do with the traditional family I grew up in.
Anyways...she accepted it but that was not the end.

She had no friends, no dad and a messed up relationship to her mother. I was everything she had and she was obsessed with me. She would be with me every day and all the time. And when we were not together we were on the phone talking to each other.
Even when I went to my (male) friends she would insist on being there with me. When I told her that I‚Äôd like to spent time with my friends alone it broke her heart and she felt like I didn‚Äôt want her around me.
It worked again...and so she would be with me everywhere and everytime.

It became worse. She didn‚Äôt want me to go anywhere without her but to stay at home. She felt like I would cheat on her wherever I went. May it be the gym or just walking randomly in the city.
Being young, dumb and already soaked into the swamp I did what she wanted but that wasn‚Äôt for long.
We had a fight and I told her she was going too far with her jealousy and broke up with her.
She wanted me back and did everything to get me back, she threatened to harm herself, cried for days, became emaciated, came into my parents house, etc....
I wasn‚Äôt coldblooded enough and gave in...we were back together. I told her I would not accept her extreme jealousy and she said she would work on it. It felt like an accomplishment but in reality it was just going from a bad situation to a slightly less worse situation.
And of course everything became worse...

We weren‚Äôt at the same school anymore.
She was controlling my phone, calls, social media, basically everything. 
There was a festival at our school during class time so she wasn‚Äôt there. I was drunk and kissed another girl. I clearly was not loving my gf but could not manage to break up with her.
Everyone saw it so obviously she found out and we had another discussion. I told her that she had to choose if she‚Äôd forgive me or not and that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to blame her for her decision because of what I‚Äôve done (again I don‚Äòt know why I didn‚Äôt end it all here).
She forgave me if I‚Äôd promise her to never do that again.

So we were there again and it became even worse.
She did reach out to the girls from my classes via fb and threatened them to not speak to me and stuff like that.
A few years later she saw some of those girls going to the same university as me and threatened me to talk to them.
I did just let it happen.... I became more and more passive and felt helpless and unable to leave her so I just let everything happen and hoped that the relationship would somehow come to an end.
I developed a very unhealthy masturbation habit at that time, became obese and was depressed as f*** a few years later.

I don‚Äôt know what happened to my mind but I became an asshole towards everybody. 
I even had a phase where I thought my parents were the whole reason I was unhappy.
I acted like an asshole towards them. Towards anybody. Furthermore I was talking positively about my girlfriend and protecting her from every little criticism that could potentially occur. I wanted everyone to believe that I have a perfect girlfriend that would do anything for me.
Of course I never told anybody the truth about our relationship. I even broke up with family members because I was protecting her.
At that time I barely had any male friends anymore. She would often tell me that they weren‚Äôt real friends and weren‚Äôt there for me when I needed them and on top of that I was becoming more and more introvert and didn‚Äôt maintain my friendships because it would eventually all lead to fighting with my gf at some point, because she wasn‚Äôt getting all of my attention.

Years passed by...I tried to leave her a few times again...didn‚Äôt make it.
The longest break up was like two weeks. It was hard for me...don‚Äôt get me wrong the good times were really good (when I acted the way she wanted me to) but in the long run it made me unhappy and I was unhappy the majority of the time.
When we were separated I felt bad...I don‚Äôt know what exactly it was...love? The feeling that I had thrown away everything for her and now lose her too? I was asking myself if I‚Äôd ever find a girl again who would do as much for me as she did?
We met...and had a talk.... I told her how I wanted the relationship to be to work out. She was the nicest person ever, nothing like before. She accepted it. We had sex. A few days later the relationship had fallen into the same pattern again.

Our toxic relationship went on the next few years. I became passive, socially awkward, lost self confidence, became depressed, did care for nothing really.

I finished studying and started working. 
I married her. It is important to note that during those times all of my actions and decisions seemed logical to me. Looking back I would‚Äôve done a lot of things differently.
Anyways...with working a lot of things became better.
I was having social interactions again with my co workers. My social awkwardness went away, my self confidence rose, I would set borders to my wife‚Äôs behaviour and finally ‚Äûman up‚Äú.
The depressions were still there.
I didn‚Äôt know where they came from and started seeking reasons everywhere again (childhood, etc.). My wife was no support, I had to get through it myself, and I did.

We tried to get children for a long time. Didn‚Äôt work in a natural way. We managed to get pregnant with the help of artificial methods.
We got twin boys at the start of 2020.
And that did change everything. Right from the start they both gave a whole new meaning to my life. I always think about how I am a role model to them as a father and that I set the example of being a man to them.
I was and am not tolerating any of the bs from my wife anymore. None of the humiliation, insults, nothing.
We fight more than ever because of that. She is constantly giving me the feeling of acting wrong, being guilty, sometimes even being a bad father (which is the biggest lie ever). I noticed that she also makes fun of me a lot and gives me the feeling of being incapable of a lot of things.
I don‚Äôt accept such behaviour and so we end up in a lot of fights. She tries to tell me that she didn‚Äôt do or say those things and that I always get her wrong. I don‚Äôt let her fool me like that. 
It is like our kids finally woke me up from years of passivity.I see everything clearer now, I see my mistakes and don‚Äôt want to live that life anymore.
I never talked about stuff that bothered me. I was often silent and tried to solve it for myself silently. But that is over as well. I speak everything out. My wife tells me she feels like I insult her for everything that‚Äôs going wrong. She tells me I have changed and become a different person. But I don‚Äôt care anymore.

The thing that worries me is the impact of leaving her on our kids. I‚Äòd want them to grow up in a happy and healthy family with loving parents but that does not seem to work.
I talked to my wife about that and told her how I want us to treat each other with love and kindness and that I want the kids to be around me everyday. It didn‚Äôt hold for long. We end up in the same situation as always.
As kids learn by example and I don‚Äôt want our kids to end up in the same type of relationship as me, I am thinking about divorce.

As I am typing this I am laying in the hospital thinking about my whole life. I randomly stumbled upon a post about domestic violence today and reading about it was a real eye opener for me.
I was being abused... I never knew. I thought I just had a jealous/obsessive girlfriend. I don‚Äôt think she knows that she is abusive. She is not a person who thinks a lot about her behaviour, she just acts very naturally and impulsive. A lot of it certainly has to do with her father leaving her at a very young age and never seeking contact to her and her mother never actually showing her love.

How long until out of dv relationship will you be at risk for?,6,"I was wondering how long until getting out of an abusive relationship where you lived together will you be at risk for? I was only with him a bit over a year. I've been told by a dv counseller that you can be at risk for up to a year after it ends. I have no children with him but there's a history of strangulation (at least 7 times), and a threat to kill (while together), and history of dv and stalking previous gf's. I live alone. He knows where I live. There is no restraining order in place but I have started filling it out which he does not know about.  There has been no contact since January. He has gone quiet, and the last I heard from him was he wasn't coming back and doesn't want me and was going to leave anyway, that the ""healthy thing to do is move on."" As if he would know what healthy is, even though I kicked him out. Just the usual mind games.  He only blocked me few days ago after I've had him blocked for almost 2 months. Should I take that as he's moved on with his life and the risk has lessened? It feels different this time, like it's appears over for good. The other breakups was non stop harassment. But I can't shake this sick anxious feeling as it's eerie quiet, and I don't know what he's thinking. He is very, very angry whenever we breakup and he sometime holds it all in, sometimes he doesn't hold it in. Me living seperately from him makes him very angry. It always has. (I've broken up with him other times) I'm kind of hoping he just forgets I ever existed.",TW Physical Violence
Is to normal to call the police on your dad when he is physically fighting with his son me (18M) and starts choking me saying he‚Äôs going to kill me?,7,"Basically yesterday we had a family argument, and my dad‚Äôs stock market money got revealed like how much he has. Then my mom was in my room crying like crazy because she is working 5 days a week and has so many expenses to pay. I saw my dad as usually just walking around not paying attention to my mom. Like why is he married to her she. Every time she cries and becomes depressed he basically doesn't even come and talk to her, stays in another room. That just pisses me so I I said can you come here, can't you see my mom is crying why don't you ever talk to her not once about anything in the last 10 years. 

And then I said, I don't care about your stock market money, I care about my mom, he became so mad, I've never seen him like that in my life. Usually when I was under 18 my dad would wrestle me grab me and scream at me. But this time he literally threw me on the bed said 5 times he was going to kill me and was choking me basically till I couldn't breathe. Then my mom tried to stop him and he started wrestling my mom and threw her on the floor. He‚Äôs never been cheat on my mom or been physical with my mom. I think he was just trying to get her out of the way so he could fight me. Basically then my mom said she was going to kill herself. I just got out to the room, pressed the emergency button on my phone. Then it started calling, I hung up the phone like immediately while it was still calling. Next thing I get is like 10 phone calls to my phone saying they sent the police. They came, I told them nothing physical happen, not one did anything and it was just a massive argument. They basically calmed everything down and left, but I never was this scared of my dad in my life, I didn't think he would choke me so I can't breathe, like not like a light choke but an actual one, and then throw my mom on the floor.

Seriously, I don't know if it was the right thing to do but I didn't want anyone to get physically hurt or if it Dad did just me or leave damage on my body then I know my mom would probably divorce him so I didn't want that to happen. Another thing is that my dad never talks to me about anything in my life, other than sports, so he basically just fight me not punching, like seriously when is this shit gonna stop, what happens if I'm 25 and I have my wife or girlfriend in the house and he does that in front of them.

So was I right in calling the police, or trying to call them, or was this a stupid decision.

TL;DR Basically had a massive argument in the house, my dad has wrestle/ got physical with me before I was 18. Now after I am 18 in college, there was an argument about his stock market money. I said I don't care about them. He then this time started to get a lot more physical with me, said he was going to kill me 5 time a, then started choking me so I can't breathe, and threw my mom on the floor. I press the emergency button on my phone to call the police, hung up immediately, got 10 calls, the police show up regard less, I told them nothing physical happen, they calmed everyone down and left. Was I right in calling or attempting to call the police in this situation?",TW Physical Violence
I messaged my abusers ex.,9,"As my other posts say I kicked out my abusive ex bf almost 2 months ago. There was a history of physcial and mental abuse. When he left he sent me nasty messages and played mind games, and blame me obv. He also messaged my toxic family and told them I need help. I didn't react to this much and was actually pretty polite to him about it because I still loved him so much.  He has been blocked for a month and few weeks. I've been getting counselling and organising a restraining order. This morning I messaged his ex gf and child's mother who has a restraining order on him. The reason why was I just wanted to warn her that he is still abusive and will be on the prowl again and that he is living in her area. Well I ended up unsending it before she read it. I realised it could increase the danger for me , and also could possibly trigger her. The gf before me also messaged her about abuse as well, and they got along and shared stories, but I realised it's for the best I just don't talk to her.  Am I a bad person for trying to warn her? Like she didn't even need warning because she already knows. I just want him to stop hurting women and that was my way of trying to stop it. He's 25 and has been abusing women since high school. He has a history of stalking and strangulation and other abuse. I've decided to not be involved at all in that. Like I said I deleted the message before she saw it. I just feel like this makes me as crazy as him because I wanted to warn her. I feel dumb as he is actually quiet and has let me be for once, and I could've ruined that by messaging her which would anger him.",TW Physical Violence
Neck grabbing statistics!,10,Can you guys help me find the legit scientific statistics of the throat grabbing stuff abusers do?

I (18F) don't know how to mentally heal after being abused by my lifelong friend/crush (18M),6," TL;DR: My lifelong friend/crush (18M, 14M at the time) abused me (18F, 14F at the time) and since then, I've had strong anxiety attacks whenever I have feelings for anyone else. I'm thinking about writing him a letter or calling him to tell him the effect he's had on me (to help give me closure and to mentally heal), but I don't know how he'll react. Should I? If not, how should I mentally heal from this?

I (18F) used to be friends with this guy, we‚Äôll call him Aiden (18M) although that‚Äôs not his real name. We were friends from birth because our moms were best friends from middle/high school and are still friends. They used to live in my city but then moved 2 states away when they were young, but we still kept in touch. We used to talk on the phone and write emails back and forth, or text. Also their grandparents still live in my town so they used to come for a week in the summer and I‚Äôd see them then. The history between me and Aiden with everything that happened is kind of complicated.

I‚Äôd say we were fine up until we were like 13. We started texting more, which brought up some new issues. He would always do stupid ‚Äúpranks‚Äù on me that weren‚Äôt at all funny. Some of them were just lies for no reason. Some I can remember off the top of my head are him saying his dog died, him pretending to be his mom saying he was in the hospital because he stabbed himself, him pretending to be his mom saying he was getting his phone taken away, etc. He would also do annoying things like spam me. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know what spamming is, it‚Äôs sending texts over and over, just so the person‚Äôs phone keeps dinging. So like when he got bored and we were talking, he‚Äôd just start spamming me. Or if there was something he wanted, he‚Äôd spam me to try to get it. An example I can remember is when his mom found her old bike combination lock from when she was 12, but forgot the combination. Aiden thought my mom might know it, so he asked me to ask her. I did, and obviously since they were 12, she didn‚Äôt remember. Apparently Aiden thought she did remember and I was just saying that she didn‚Äôt, because he started spamming me asking what it was. 120 texts later and I still didn‚Äôt know. It got incredibly annoying over time.

Another thing he‚Äôd do is his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (it could‚Äôve been him the whole time just saying it was his friends) would get into his phone and just say whatever they wanted. So I would never know if I was really talking to him, or if he was going to lie to me, or spam me, or ‚Äúprank‚Äù me. He seemed to have a short attention span and whenever he would get bored, he‚Äôd cause trouble. We had some good times too and had fun together, but sometimes he‚Äôd do stupid stuff that was kind of manipulative and mean.

Some examples were one time, he decided I was saying ‚Äúlol‚Äù too much. So he said if I said ‚Äúlol‚Äù again, he would block me for certain amount of time. Then, he demanded I apologize and said I had to say ‚ÄúYes Aiden‚Äù to indicate that I understood. Which was very weird to me because it‚Äôs as if he was trying to get me to submiss. Keep in mind this was when we were 13/14. So at first I was like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just saying lol, it‚Äôs not a big deal, I don‚Äôt need to apologize‚Äù. And then he started ""counting up"", like saying ""3 weeks now. 4 weeks now"". My ‚Äúblocking time‚Äù increased with the time I didn‚Äôt apologize and because I was being a ‚Äúsmart aleck‚Äù. Then I said, ‚ÄúWhatever, sorry lol even though I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to be apologizing for.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt do that ‚Äúlol‚Äù on purpose, it just slipped out. And then he said something I still remember to this day. He said ‚ÄúListen here sweetheart, I‚Äôm the shark and you‚Äôre the mino. You catch my drift? I‚Äôm the boss. This is as real as it gets. And remember, all you had to do was apologize. I‚Äôll unblock you 4 months from now. Bye!‚Äù. And he blocked me. He ended up unblocking me before the 4 months was up, it was probably a month after he originally blocked me, but still the fact that he carried on this ‚Äúprank‚Äù that long was upsetting.

At this point you‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôd want to be friends with someone like this. I guess since we‚Äôd been friends for so long, I was willing to tolerate more? Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I put up with as much as I did. Another thing was after awhile, I started to have feelings for him. So that kind of made my judgment bad and made me blind to his negative qualities.

For my 14th birthday, for my present I wanted to go on a trip to a big amusement park with Aiden. It was in the state between us, so Aiden and I and our moms were going to meet up and stay at a rental house together and go to the amusement park and hang out. I thought it was going to be super fun. Some time around a month before the trip, another unfortunate Aiden incident happened. I told him he should make a Facebook account because I thought it‚Äôd be fun, and he said he would. I assumed he‚Äôd be making his own facebook account, obviously. But he made a facebook account with MY name, except spelled the last name wrong because I guess he forgot how it was spelled. Then, he started making inappropriate posts. I saw what he did and I was like ‚ÄúWhat the heck‚Äù, and then he was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna steal your profile picture and put it on my account‚Äù. So at that point it would look like it was me- same profile picture, same name (pretty much), except him posting whatever he wanted. It would make me look bad. So I told him to take it down. And then he started getting all defensive basically saying it‚Äôs his account and he can do whatever he wants. Then he claimed he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know how to take it down‚Äù. And then I threatened to tell my mom who would tell his mom and get him in trouble, but he said if I told on him, his mom just wouldn‚Äôt let him go on the amusement park trip we had planned, so I was ‚Äúshooting myself in the foot‚Äù. Which was really manipulative of him. I got really upset with him and basically I had to tell him that I was crying in order to get him to change his name. And he did, but it shouldn‚Äôt have had to come to that. There‚Äôs honestly probably a lot more that I‚Äôm leaving out about our history but I don‚Äôt want to make this post more of a novel than it already is.

The real trouble starts on the trip to the amusement park. We were going to be at the rental house for 4 days, 3 nights (except the days getting there and coming home were like half days obviously). So the day we got there, things went pretty well. Nothing too notable happened. The next day, we went to the amusement park. We had fast passes so we could pretty much just walk on all of the rides. Everything was going good for the first few hours, we were having fun. Then we got in line for one of the bigger rollercoasters, one of the ones that the fast pass didn‚Äôt apply to so we had to wait in line with everyone else. The line was like 45 minutes or an hour long, and Aiden got bored. And if you read our history, you know that Aiden and boredom is never a good combination.

Like halfway through our wait in line, Aiden started to playfully hit me. And I thought he was kidding around at first so I playfully hit back. Then he started to hit harder, and it wasn‚Äôt playful anymore so I told him to stop. And he did, for a second. And then he started back up again, hitting me harder. And kicking harder too. And I kept telling him to stop, and he kept not listening. Or he would listen for a few seconds and then start back up again. It was leaving red marks on my arm and I was getting scared because obviously someone hitting you is kind of scary. So then I started crying. And then he was shocked and confused about why I was crying because he ‚Äúthought it was a game‚Äù. He thought everything was a game. I told him that I said stop but he didn‚Äôt listen, and he said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know I was that sensitive‚Äù. He offered me a free punch at him, but I didn‚Äôt take it because I cared about him and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him. But I just couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Once I get crying, it takes me awhile to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù if you get what I‚Äôm saying. We got on the ride and I was still half-crying. We got off the ride and I was still half-crying. Then, our moms texted us that they wanted to meet up with us for lunch and to reapply sunscreen. It was on the other side of the park so we started walking. He knew that if our moms saw me crying, they‚Äôd want to know what happened, and he didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. I didn‚Äôt want him to get in trouble either because if he got in trouble, that would mean the rest of our trip wouldn‚Äôt be as fun. So the entire time we were walking to our parents, he was trying everything to cheer me up. He was singing along to the songs playing in the park but inserting stupid lyrics he made up to try to make me laugh. And by the time we got to our parents I wasn‚Äôt crying anymore, but the whole situation is still kind of sad. I shouldn‚Äôt have protected him like that. After that, the rest of the day went pretty well, but it‚Äôs not over.

The next day, we were supposed to go to a famous waterpark, but their tickets were sold out so we had to find something new to do. We ended up spending the morning in the rental house, and again, Aiden got bored. Our moms were in the kitchen and we were in the living room watching TV. Then, he grabbed a pillow and started hitting me with it. I was trying to block it but he just kept going. And then he said to our parents ‚ÄúI can make her cry, watch!‚Äù. And kept hitting me harder with the pillow. Our moms pretty much paid him no attention though because they were doing something and knew how Aiden could be. So anyways, he kept hitting me with the pillow and shouting ‚ÄúCRY!‚Äù and like from what happened the day before and the impact of the pillow, and him yelling at me to cry, I got up to go to the bathroom to cry. I tried to calm myself down and when I came back, he was celebrating and was proud that I cried. Then he did it again where he was hitting me with the pillow trying to get it to happen again and I cried again, because he was scaring me at that point. Then then I came back from the bathroom again and he was proud that he made me cry. Then just the sound of his voice was enough to upset me again. Then, our moms decided it was time to go out to lunch so before we left, I told my mom that Aiden was being too rough with me, and she told Aiden‚Äôs mom, who took Aiden outside to yell at him. He was arguing with her saying we were ‚Äújust having fun‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI liked it‚Äù. I truly feel like Aiden is a psychopath or something, enjoying seeing the pain he inflicts on others. He thinks everything is a game and disrespects boundaries like no tomorrow. I can‚Äôt put into words how bad of a friend he was.

After that, we didn‚Äôt have any more ‚Äúincidents‚Äù, but my feelings for him had disappeared immediately, like someone flipped a switch. So that was good. The next day, we went home. I went to my state and he went to his, and we never talked again. Not once. He didn‚Äôt try to contact me and I didn‚Äôt try to contact him. At first after I got back home, I thought we‚Äôd remain friends but this was just a ‚Äúbump in the road‚Äù and we‚Äôd go back to being friends. But I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to message him, so I didn‚Äôt. But just because I was no longer talking to Aiden didn‚Äôt mean that it was over.

After I got back home, I noticed slight changes in myself, like I was more skittish in a way. It‚Äôs not until I got feelings for another guy that I‚Äôd realized what an impact Aiden had on me. So when I got feelings for the new guy, I was struck with intense anxiety. It was so strong that whenever I would see him, I‚Äôd have an anxiety attack so strong that I‚Äôd throw up. And it was never a conscious thing like in my head, I was thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared my new crush is gonna do what Aiden did to me‚Äù. It was a type of thing where my brain/body knew I was going to see my crush, and reacted in that way. It was out of my control and nothing I did to stop the anxiety attack could help. The nausea was horrible and once it started, there was pretty much no stopping it. Another notable thing is my anxiety never happened around guys I didn‚Äôt have feelings for, I could be around them with no problem. It‚Äôs only guys I have feelings for. I did counseling for a few months when I was 15 but the counselor pretty much did nothing for me because she was focusing more on my new crush and not as much on my past problems with Aiden. But not long after I stopped counseling, my feelings for my new crush at the time stopped, so my anxiety stopped as well.

Then, last fall I decided to start therapy again since I‚Äôd be starting college soon and I didn‚Äôt want my anxiety to get in the way of future relationships. While that therapist helped me to realize that I‚Äôd been abused, she didn‚Äôt help to stop my anxiety, because she was kind of like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll cross that bridge when we come to it‚Äù like when I get feelings for someone new (which is kind of hard during a pandemic). I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I‚Äôve tried so hard for closure. I‚Äôve tried writing down my thoughts in a ‚Äúclosure letter‚Äù and burning it, I‚Äôve tried therapy/counseling, but my anxiety keeps happening whenever I have feelings for someone.

So recently, someone told me that I should call Aiden to talk and to tell him all the effects he‚Äôs had on me, or to write him a letter about it, because if he apologizes, it may make things easier for me. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs changed (since it‚Äôs been 3 ¬Ω years) or if he‚Äôll respond positively or negatively to my efforts. If he responds positively, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll get rid of my anxiety but at least it‚Äôll make me feel better. If he responds negatively and basically tells me to go screw myself, or laughs and is proud of the effect he‚Äôs had on me, I‚Äôll feel upset. So I don‚Äôt know what to do or if I should listen to the person who advised me to write a letter or call him. Should I write a letter or call him for closure? And if so, which is better? If none of these things will work, what do you suggest for closure/mentally healing and getting rid of my anxiety? Thanks for reading this long post and I look forward to hearing your advice!

Do abusers ever change? What was a clear sign for you to end the relationship?,24,"Hi all,

Have you ever been in a relationship with an abuser who changed their ways? If yes, what influenced that change? If not, what was a clear sign for you to call it quits?

How do you get an abuser out of your house? (I solely own my house)

Backstory: My (F26) boyfriend (M27) and I have been together for over a year now and we both live in my house. He grew up in an abusive household with alcoholic parents. He has carried many issues from his upbringing into his own life. He drinks alcohol daily. He has anger problems. I have always tried to be understanding knowing what his childhood was like and knowing that he suffers from depression. Things started to get violent last summer. It is not a daily occurrence, maybe once every few months we get into what I would consider a brawl. I keep giving him chances to change because I have known him since middle school and the good side of him is my best friend.

Last night was the latest episode resulting in me getting punched in the face and one of my vases being thrown down the stairs shattering everywhere. This was preceded by me waking up at 4:30 am to use the bathroom and smelling cigarette smoke. He knows I dont allow smoking in my house or my car. I went downstairs to confront him and it escalated from there. I could not have an adult conversation with him. First he tried lying (there was a beer can covered in ashes on the table so obviously he was smoking inside).  I called him out on his bs and how this has happened multiple times and he is disrespecting me and my property that I work hard for. He also knows I have asthma. 

He ended up yelling at me to shut up and going upstairs. I continued to confront him in our room and told him between this disrespect and the constant lying (caught him on chat sites numerous times talking to other women), and his drinking, that I was done. He proceeded to tell me he would ‚Äúbury me in the basement‚Äù and refused to leave. The physical fighting started after he took my vase and threatened to break it, I tried taking it back and it went from there. 

Every time this happens he begs for forgiveness stating I made him mad and him hitting me was an accident. The next day he acts like nothing happened. He said he would stop drinking, but I have serious doubts. 

Other things he has threatened me with but then says he wasnt being serious and was just mad: setting my house on fire with me inside, setting my car on fire, breaking anything he can get his hands on. 

I dont want to get him arrested and him lose his job and he has also threatened me with CPS. I take great care of my child, but we live in a state where recreational cannabis is legal and I do partake. I dont know what if anything would happen, but he uses that against me if I threaten to file a police report. My child was not home to witness this episode.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Is this normal?,2,"Hey everyone. 
First time poster. Long time lurker. 
A little backstory. 
I was in an abusive relationship for 5 years. Physical and mental. We have two kids together. In 2017, we were no longer together, but he came to the town I moved to and held a gun to my head and kept me prisoner in my car.  He went to jail for a short while, but has since been out, then back in, and so on and so forth. Okay now for the question. 
How many of you have huge places of your memory missing from trauma? I don‚Äôt remember any of my sons younger years. I find myself saying things like ‚Äúoh Marley used to do this‚Äù (my daughter who is older and born before the abuse got to it‚Äôs worst) and my son will ask about his experiences and I just don‚Äôt have much to tell him. I‚Äôve lost baby clothes and toys from moving around house to house to escape. I have very few photos it seems. I try so hard to remember these things. I feel so much guilt. Sometimes I go through our places we rented, one by one, and try and remember specific occurrences. But there‚Äôs so much trauma hidden behind those memories. So many dirty dishes. Crying babies. Poverty. I went to school and worked full time while he stayed home. Every place we rented ended up destroyed. But I want to remember my son. Are these memories going to come back? Is this a response to unresolved trauma? I do see a therapist and am medicated for MDD. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice? Or maybe just some solidarity. Thanks in advanced. üíú",TW Physical Violence
One of the better weeks,3,"My husband hasn‚Äôt hit me since the last time a week and a half or a couple of weeks ago. It‚Äôs nice not to feel beaten or bruised. However, I realize no matter how much he changes, so much of him makes me flinch. 

He jokes that if I divorce him or if we had a child and I tried to take that child he would kill me. He says it‚Äôs a joke because he knows I‚Äôm not stupid enough to take his child. I told him that it bothered me how easy he talks about such a horrific thing.

He‚Äôs not hitting me anymore but I‚Äôm still scared of his temper, walking on eggshells.

When things are good they are supposed to be good but instead I‚Äôm terrified of his anger, his frustration, his cheating problem.

I did it....,3,Today my partner and I decided to break up and go our separate ways.

Is this scenario possible??,12,"First of all, this is a throwaway account, and I've never posted here before. This is totally new to me, and just recently happened this week.

My boyfriend has recently been experiencing a lot of mental health issues, just due to the pandemic and job stress, and he recently found out some family things that were really upsetting for him. When he gets triggered like this, his go-to is alcohol as a coping mechanism unfortunately.

The other night, he started drinking and consumed quite a bit of alcohol in a short amount of time. I could tell it was going to be a challenging night, so I basically excused myself to the bedroom and told him I didn't feel well and I was going to bed.  My hope was that he would pass out on the couch and sleep it off.

However, around 11:00 p.m. he kept coming into the bedroom and trying to talk to me and I was just not interested in chatting. I kept sending him back out into the living room. Finally he came in and was being really rude and every time I would try to usher him out of the room he would shove me onto the bed. (I'm smaller than him and he's a very muscular guy.) At one point when I raised my voice at him and told him to get out (while I was getting up off the bed) he drunkenly swung at me and grazed my knee. I wasn't injured, it just scared me more than anything, and I shoved him out of the room and locked the door. He then proceeded to break down the door and I was so scared that I called the police while he was banging away at it. He did come into the room, but did nothing physical after that. Then the police arrived.

My intention was to have the police come and speak with him, maybe even take him to the hospital and get him some help with detoxing, or something. but as I told the story they informed me that they were taking him in for domestic assault. they told me he wouldn't be able to have contact with me, etc. I was so stunned after all was said and done. He has never been violent with me - ever. We talked in the days prior about him starting some kind of treatment or at least getting started with counseling and he was fully on board with it. Unfortunately we didn't get that chance, and now I'm worried that he's going to have to spend time in jail. I know that I can't really retract anything I said, because it won't matter. The prosecutor will just charge it as they see fit. But I really don't know what to do from here.

I am so conflicted. I want him to get help, and I don't want his life ruined because of this. But I also know that I will not be with him unless he is actively taking steps to get help. He lives with me and he's already talking about moving out obviously, especially if he can't have any contact with me...  I believe that it's probably for the best that we don't live together right now, because this can give us both some space and he can work on himself. And if he does slip up I can just leave and I don't have to worry about kicking him out of my apartment. I believe I will be able to more easily enforce boundaries that way.

But I'm just struggling, because I don't know how this might turn out. Any thoughts? I don't know what answers I'm looking for honestly, I just had to get this out somewhere.",TW Physical Violence
if i consent to it is it abuse?,22,"TW physical violence, sex. 

I‚Äôm sorry to ask but I‚Äôve been really unsure lately as to whether or not this relationship dynamic is safe or healthy. 

When I (F21) met my boyfriend (M24), we both expressed that we would be open to experimentation in the bedroom. I have only had 2 previous partners while he‚Äôs had quite a few, so I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm into. 

This is relevant because I gave him permission to slap/spank me etc. (which he said he likes doing) but I thought that it was kind of a bedroom thing I guess? 

About a month in he just started hitting me out of nowhere. Or punching my legs or arms, but never really hard enough to leave a mark although when it caught me off guard I would sometimes fall over. I don‚Äôt know, I laughed because this clearly wasn‚Äôt out of anger or anything; we weren‚Äôt fighting, he was just playing. 

Then he started pinching me so hard I‚Äôd scream and slapping me lightly in front of his friends and they would all laugh and say ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù but it seemed more like a joke. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this but it was kind of a joke that he was abusing me I guess? Because he wasn‚Äôt really. 

And then recently we were sort of jokingly playfighting then he hit me in the shoulder. Like, closed fist, full bodied force, and I immediately curled up, but still laughed because this was our joke, you know? He hit me again and I asked him to stop and then again a few more times. It was strange because I didn‚Äôt feel scared, but I started crying. Not because it hurt I think it was just shock and he looked so scared and he started crying too and held me for hours. He said he thought we were playing around and he didn‚Äôt mean to. 

To be fair, I do sometimes hit back, which is where I feel like I‚Äôm still consenting to it. You know, he‚Äôll smack me and I‚Äôll immediately smack back, lighter though. And I‚Äôll laugh, which I guess is misleading. I don‚Äôt like it but I guess I don‚Äôt really mind it? 

I had to walk around for weeks with that bruise on my shoulder, and promised my 3 different people he wasn‚Äôt abusing me because I kind of don‚Äôt think he is. I think he‚Äôd stop if I asked. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I hope I‚Äôm not wasting anyone‚Äôs time. I know I‚Äôm rambling so I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs kind of unreadable. I just feel like i‚Äôve somewhat asked for it, and drawing the boundary now would be strange.",TW Physical Violence

Horrible MIL,3,"I can't stand my MIL. Last October, I took charges out on my husband and got a protective order. They never served him with the order or arrested him. He knows how hard it is for me to go to court, so he showed up and signed the protective order that my attorney drafted. He continues to provide for me financially, bc I can't work right now and we have children. He got into a fender bender and reported it to the police. While they were there, they saw he had an arrest warrant for the charges I took out. He was arrested and his mom is completely blaming me for it all. Demanding he never hit me and to drop the charges. She blames me and continues to say he supposedly hit me, even though he has repeatedly told her he did and has done several times while drunk. Why can't she just accept it and leave me alone? I'm so tired of being blamed for something that wasn't my fault. I really, truly hate this woman. She refuses to accept her fault in his alcoholism and blames me for it. This bitch started buying him liquor at 14 or 15 years old. What did she think would happen?

Extreme narcissistic behavior,4,"

Long story short, filed for divorce in June. Wife kept running off etc. she eventually convinced me she‚Äôd changed and gradually moved back in under my nose. I never ‚Äúofficially‚Äù said she could move back in, but there was no way I could prove she ever left to begin with, so cops couldn‚Äôt make her leave. 


Anyway, she started her crap again about a month later. We already had a custody arrangement for our baby daughter. I have her the majority of the time, and wife gets her every other weekend. Since she refused to leave the house, and I was tired of the constant being berated, not knowing when she was coming/going (liked to go party every single night at bars. Would come home after midnight or not at all), constantly being called all kinds of names. Being told I was controlling because I‚Äôd ask her not to go out partying every single night. 

One night, she comes home a little after midnight drunk. She‚Äôd been screaming at me on the phone on her way home and was acting irate again. 

She came in and jerked my phone out of my hand and ran off to the other end of the house (as she‚Äôs often done in the past to keep me from calling the police). I followed her and grabbed my phone and pulled it from her hand. She then punched me in the groin several times and then started hitting me in the head. 

She hit me hard enough to cause my Apple Watch fall detection to activate and it called the police. 

I had started a video on my phone right after she punched me, as I‚Äôm used to her lying and claiming things happened when they didn‚Äôt. During the call she started screaming ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got a gun on me!!!‚Äù She didn‚Äôt know I was recording video to prove that statement was false, however. 

Cops show up and check us both out and get statements. She changed her story with the officers several time‚Äôs and it‚Äôs all documented in the report. First told them there never was a physical altercation. Then told them I‚Äôd pushed her to the ground and hit her. Then told them she had no video of it. Then changed it to she did have a video of me doing that, but would not show it to them because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt trust them ‚Äú

After that, a week goes by. She‚Äôs calling me names, telling me constantly that I hit her and all sorts of things. Constantly talking about it. Trying to gaslight me into believing I‚Äôd hit her (presumably trying to get me to admit to something I didn‚Äôt do in order to have me arrested and take my baby away from me or similar)

She was walking around the house naked, not letting me sleep (would come beat on the spare bedroom door every couple of hours to wake me) she‚Äôd keep forcefully plopping down in my lap and refuse to get off of me. Then call me ‚Äúlittle bitch‚Äù. 

 I told her I wasn‚Äôt doing it anymore and would be taking our baby to my moms during my time with her and bringing her back to the house on her visitation days. 

Well, she didn‚Äôt like that. Next day county officers show up to serve me with an ex-parte TPO. They took all my guns, my parental rights, and removed me from my home. 

During this time, I was gathering as much evidence as possible. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs trauma response or what. But I came across all kinds of videos and pictures of her abusing me that I‚Äôd 100% blocked from my mind. 

One example was her physically barring me from leaving the house and jerking me around so hard she ripped a 1ft. Hole in my shirt. All kinds of stuff like that, that I‚Äôd never believe happened without seeing those videos and pictures. 



Already had the hearing. She lied so much in her testimony that I didn‚Äôt even have to speak. My lawyer cross examined her and the judge said to go back to our previous custody arrangement. She then tried to take the house as she ‚Äúhad nowhere else to go‚Äù. But after learning she‚Äôd be responsible for the mortgage, they told her she has 30 days to get out. 

They‚Äôre also putting in a mutual restraining order. 

Moral of the story. Be REAL careful around people. Had I not gathered evidence of her being the one abusing me, this could have easily destroyed my life. 

I realize this stuff is usually the other way around, with women being abused. But it happens to men too. There are some evil women in the world who know how to ‚Äúplay the system‚Äù.",TW Physical Violence
Missing him again.,7,"TW: My abuser moved out mid January. It's March now. I have had no contact with him for a month or so. I have blocked him on everything. And he is staying at his mum's. I am living alone in a small studio with my cat. I know in the long run I'm so much better off without my abuser and I've even gone a while without missing or loving him but my emotions just come out of nowhere and I miss him again since yesterday. What the hell. I've gotten my hair and eyebrows done, made some friends but I don't think enough, and I also am in regular counselling and even have a dv case worker now. I also did a little bit of paid work. I feel like I am not doing enough and that he has won still. I have tried to date as well but I struggle too much to get close to men. I did spend the night with one (mutual friend) and just cuddled him and it did feel good, but we don't see each other much. I always think I won't find another bf as my ex convinced me no guy will put up with me. After I kicked him out he also played mind games after leaving and told me he is the one dumping me, and ending things and that he doesn't want me because I'm crazy, etc. I asked him back first night, but not after that.  I didn't put a restraining order on my ex yet as he has been quiet for now, plus I've been extremely busy, but I am filling out a restraining order form for my case worker tomorrow as she sent me a template for it. Honestly would he have eventually killed me if I didn't kick him out? He strangled me at least 7 times during the relationship. Am I even still at risk even though it's over now? I honestly went a while without missing him. I don't know why I'm emotional all of a sudden again. I also suffer server PTSD and sometimes I still think he is in my studio attacking me. I can still feel him on me attacking me and strangling me.",TW Physical Violence
He just got arrested last week,25,"So my partner of almost 5 yrs got arrested last week for domestic violence towards me and my sister and a few other charges. To make the long story short, I've been with him since high school and have noticed signs of mental illnesses and whatnot. I've narrowed it down to narcissistic, borderline personality disorder, and possibly bipolar disorder. His dad has anger management issues, his mom is diagnosed with bipolar and he has always had anger issues as well. He was often mad and would yell at me for the littlest of things such as if we are playing a game together and I accidentally died (I suck at games but we play together because I know he likes it) he would yell and I call me names, insults me and whatnot. when we moved in together in college, he got physical. he would punch me and hit me and thrown me around like a rag doll. I remember him grabbing my head and slamming it into the fridge in our apartment and the first time he punched me till I bleed in my nose. I wanted to leave at the time but I was scared. Then he stopped, told me he'd never hit me again because he found God. Now, I am religious, not in the best way but I believe in God. So when he told me he found God and decided to be better, I thought maybe this will be our turning point. he was the best for a few weeks, then we started fighting again. he would yell and scream and call me by names and insults. I never said anything because to him it's defiant towards him because he is the man of the household. he eventually quits his job and I was left to support us and my 3 huskies. we moved to a different place because his best friend was supposed to be living with us but they fell off before our move-in date so he never signed the lease. then he would often bring up the idea of a 3 person relationship. this has always been a subject throughout our relationship. it has never been an official thing. he hooked up with my roommate his first year of college, then told me he wasn't gonna do it again. it was completely official when my sister got involved. I told him that it was okay because in my mind it's the least I can do for him because he has done so much for me.

that's when his discipline method got worst. before my sister, he wasn't hitting me anymore but it was more of him choking me out till I submit to him and he'll sit on me till I gave in. but when my sister started to live with us he started to do more. he'll tell her that I'm being possessed by an evil spirit and would tell her to go and choke me and he would join and they would choke me out till I peed my pants or till I was out completely, then he would stand on my chest and jump. he would tell me to go choke her if she ever defies him. If I don't do it he would do that to me only worst. he was always favoring her and give her the lighter discipline and make it a horrific experience for me. Another disciplinary action would be he would put our hands in hot water, and or dunk our heads in cold water till we can't breathe anymore. towards the end, I was mortified every time he would raise his voice or if he even said that I'm defying him. my sister finally broke one night after he told her to leave the house she left and called my mom. from there they got the cops involved and he was arrested later that afternoon. I had wished that I would have a breaking point as my sister does. but I wanted him to get better, I want him to feel better to cope better with his problems. I love him

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't know how to feel right now because I know what he did was wrong and that it should never have happened. but towards the end he was such a gentleman towards me, he was sweet, I got to see what he was like back in high school again and I really miss him. I really think that our relationship is going to get better. but I also know that if he ever comes back what he did to me will come back and it's never gonna change. I don't know what to do now because his mom keeps texting me updating the status of his case and what she wants to do. she keeps asking me questions about him that make me worry about him and it makes me want to bail him out because I have the money to. but I also know that I'm going to put myself and my sister in danger if he gets out. I don't know what to do or what to think because I miss him and I miss being with him. my dogs remind me of him, my place reminds me of him everything I come home to reminds me of him and I'm just a sad mess. my mom has been really supportive but I don't know if I'll ever come out of this mess. he has made me feel worthless, he made me feel like I'm nothing but a piece of shit good for nothing.

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't normally put my life on the internet like this but I'm stuck and lost and I don't know where else to turn. I don't expect anyone to have read this far but if you have, thank you for reading about me complaining about my life I appreciate it, I just want to be at peace...

Additional TW: mentions of violence,2,"Hello everyone. Me and my hopefully STBXH were supposed to do couples therapy today. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been asking him to do for the past 3ish years. But, he decided today was going to be a day where he screamed at me at the top of his lungs for our hour total car ride, call me all sorts of names, berate me in public, and then block my car from leaving at the end of our errands. There‚Äôs more to it, but that‚Äôs the gist. In the past, he‚Äôs done this (probably once a month or so) and when I tell him I‚Äôm exhausted from hearing him scream at me, because hours and hours go by, he blocks my exit from the room or from the house. Anyway, he decided he wasn‚Äôt going to partake in therapy today so I drove off and found somewhere to park and wait for a few hours. The psychologist was really nice but kept stating that what he was doing was physical abuse (I had always assumed it was mental or emotional abuse). I‚Äôm wanting a divorce, he isn‚Äôt. The psychologist suggested that I get a restraining order since his abuse lasts for hours and I am afraid of him (he‚Äôs never physically touched me). Is this something that qualifies for a restraining order? It happens frequently enough, but I worry the courts won‚Äôt view it as severe enough.

Is this Domestic Violence?,6,"About 2 years ago, I got into an argument with my Dad over a misogynistic comment he made to me. While we have always argued, this was the first time he actually got physical. To be honest, everything seems like a blur and I can‚Äôt remember whether he punched me or not. But at one point he started to push me, I started fighting back, so  he started choking me. My sister was nearby so she pulled him away from me. However, when he saw that she started to help me, he began dragging her around the house by pulling her hair, while yelling that I was causing him to hurt her. Keep in mind that this happened in front of my mom who didn‚Äôt intervene and just stood by while my dad was hurting my sister and I. The next day, my mom spoke to me and told me that I deserved to get hit and that I was to blame for getting my sister involved. She also told me I had to forgive my dad since one of the 10 commandments says I have to respect my parents. 
My parents  likes to sweep stuff under the rug since they like to keep up appearances so we never talked about it again. And honestly, I purposely started work longer hours at work and began sleeping over at friend‚Äôs houses over the weekends to keep me from being at home. 

But that situation has changed now that Covid started. Today my dad started to get in my face and started pushing me (again in front of my mom) and she just walked away. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to but is this considered domestic violence?

 I also came to the realization that even if I try to move out I won‚Äôt be able to take my car since it‚Äôs under my dad‚Äôs name (even though I‚Äôm paying all the bills for it).

Partial Update; Frustrated With ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù System Here,7,"My husband was arrested for trying to kill me 1.5 weeks before Christmas. I posted about it and was freaked out about going to court for the Order Of Protection.

I made it through court and received the order for a year. His arraignment date was supposed to be Jan. 4th. Court was shut down due to Covid and his new date given was March 8th. I have been calling the DAs office since the week after Christmas. I was given their card and told to call them if I didn‚Äôt hear from them by Dec 28. Had to leave a voicemail. Have called EVERY WEEK SINCE and have not spoken to a human in all that time. Everyone is still working from home so I don‚Äôt have the option of just showing up to the office to speak to someone.

I remember when the DA opened his law practice here many years ago. I worked for an attorney back then that went toe to toe with him in court on many occasions. I was surprised he was able to become DA in this town. He‚Äôs not a bad person, just not really competent in my opinion. This whole scenario I‚Äôm living is only proving my opinion to be true. 

I‚Äôm exhausted. My husband wiped our bank account out and shut it down the day after he was released from jail. Why I was dumbfounded that he did that AFTER he tried to take my life is beyond me. It took weeks of going hungry and without meds to dig myself out of the financial abyss I was in. 

Every time I think it‚Äôs going to get better I get knocked back down. He quit his job that our medical insurance was through. I have lupus and epilepsy and have to have my meds to exist on this planet so 80% of my income has gone to cover my dr‚Äôs appointments and prescription meds. I‚Äôve even started taking my meds every other day just to get by. 

He was able to get a new job making 3 times what he was making last year. I only know this because an acquaintance asked me how he was liking his new job. So he‚Äôs doing quite well while I go without. 

I feel completely abandoned. The only interaction I‚Äôve had with anyone involving my case was when the cops showed up to my door on Super Bowl Sunday. Scared me and my fat little savior of a dog. They received a 911 hang up call and it came from my general area. One of the officers that were at my door was there the day my husband was arrested. He was sure it was me and that my husband had come back to finish me off. Told him that no one was here and I appreciated them checking on me. About 15 mins later they came back and asked if I was sure that I was ok and alone. They received another 911 call and this time heard a woman screaming in the background. I opened the door wide (while holding my fat fluffy little savior as he barked) and showed them no one was here. Thanked them again. Realized that‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve heard from anyone involving my case since Christmas. 

I find myself thinking ‚ÄúI could probably survive if I just let him come back home‚Äù and ‚Äúmy odds of surviving living with him are probably the same as surviving not taking my meds since I cannot afford them‚Äù. I know it‚Äôs insanity but I have been completely abandoned by the justice system here other than the officers that showed up that day.

Also, his court date is now moved again as our court system will not restart again until after April 1st. This past year man.... both of my kids are nurses. Both working on Covid units. One still in another state. They have enough to worry about and don‚Äôt need to worry about their mother losing her life in one way or another.

I don't know what to do.,3,"Well to start off I'm 19yo male, and I've lived with my Nan for nearly 12 years because of my abusive father and non-maternal mother.
About 5 years ago my grandad died and my nan changed, or chose to reveal her true self not soon after I revealed that I wanted to become a forensic pathologist. She has always hated me from a young age, but my grandad wouldn't ever let her put hands on any of us.
In the house it is me, her and my 15yo sister and we get visits from other family members from time to time, and have to babysit my niece and nephew. I'm the only one that pulls the weight in the house, excluding cooking and the cleaning of clothes, everything else I do alone, along side me attending college. She has lied about her medication making her temper shorter, just as an excuse to do and say the things she does.
Long story short, before I begin, she's just out right abusive.
She constantly verbally abuses me calling me ""a degenerate cunt"", other things along the same lines and compares me to my father alot, which can really work my temper up, and she's admitted to me before that the reason she wants me to lose my temper and hit her is because I would get arrested for assaulting an elderly and then I wouldn't be able to take up forensics. She steals money off me and black mails me so I can get it back. She actively issues death threats to me saying she'd happily slit my throat and bludgeon me to death, more than once saying those sorts of things infront of my 5yo nephew. Before I touch on physical abuse, I would like to point out that she actively attempts to perv on me whether I'm in the shower or getting changed in my room, by peering through the gaps in the door or just outright bursting in, and when I bring this up to her, she gets aggressive. She destroys personal belongings, purposely ruins clothes (dropped my new white trainers in orange acrylic the other day) and hides my medication and college work to get back at me.
She has made attempts to push me down the stairs or set small, home-alone esk traps on the stairs to make me fall, she also for no apparent reason makes futile attempts to put me into a choke hold, punch me in the face and kick me in the balls, as well as trying to stab me. Alot of the time I catch her arm and she squeals claiming that I'm trying to break her arm. The other night I went out for a walk at 11pm and she locked every entrance, whether it was a window or a door, to keep me out, it was -9 ‚Å∞C, she opened a window at 1am to tell me she hopes I'd be dead in the morning, she only opened the door for my niece and nephew to come in at 9am.

After any of these sorts of events, she manages to get my phone and hides it, so I can't contact anyone.
And once she does she tells me that calling my uncle/ her son (a police officer), won't help me because he'd never believe a thing I'd say. And it's true he doesn't. And she can play a very deceptive victim card, that I can't get around.

Her mood instantly got better. I felt the sadness lift. She got on her chromebook and looked up the apartment I hope to get. She even opened up her email so she could look discreetly.

I began screaming and begging to be allowed to leave or for him to leave and stop talking, I said okay I‚Äôll stay in the spare bedroom, he wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone still. I sat against the door to keep him out, pushed it back rather hard and he fell backwards into our only full length mirror. It shattered with his weight and force and he says cut his back, however when I tried to see if he was okay he refused to show me

Domestic Violence - Beaten by boyfriend over having apps he did not know about,8,"Last night my boyfriend did the unthinkable. He beat me very hard, pulled my hair and dragged me through rooms. He kicked me in the head and punched me. This was over me lurching to grab my phone as he was about to check other messages on my phone. He keeps saying that he did this out of love and he was just so angry about my actions. What I did: I hosted a dinner with a friend I met but I lied about how I met the friend and therefore it caused for an awkward moment when the true way of meeting (through Grindr) was said. I should have been transparent and better communicated with my partner regarding this. We talked through it and everything was ok until last night when I was in the kitchen for too long. I really was just standing in the kitchen texting a friend how wonderful the dinner was and how we are looking forward to hanging out in the summer. I went back to the couch to sit with him and he wanted to see the messages which I showed him but he did not recognize the app I was using (Telegram). He therefore backtracked and went to check my other messages and that‚Äôs when I lurched for my phone. Their are private messages on that app I did not want him to see (am i allowed to have anything private, he said I should be able to share everything and it is bizarre he doesn‚Äôt have access to my phone) 
Once I lurched for my phone, he hit me in the face and kicked me off the couch then stomped on me. Then dragged me by my shirt to the front door which he was about to throw me out of but he threw me into the kitchen and then started to repeatedly kick me as I curled on the floor. Then he dragged me by my hair all the way back to the living room and threw me over the couch demanding that I leave. I was scared for a moment.  He was very angry and could have really hurt me.... he started to tell me that I got him so angry over being ‚Äúshady‚Äù and he shouldn‚Äôt have reacted that way but I need to communicate better, which is true. What should I do about this? It just doesn‚Äôt feel right.",TW Physical Violence
Update from my last post!,1,"So I called the municipal court in my city and they were really sweet, basically she said the reason they didn‚Äôt keep up with me is because 1. They couldn‚Äôt find my ex and covid was another issue and 2. In 2019 after I called, the police came, and I wrote my statement there was some type of legislation put in place for DV victims. I didn‚Äôt really ask her to explain all of that but she made it clear to me that my ex has pleaded not guilty and hired new lawyers. She said that I will be subpoenaed to appear in court in the next month, she also explained to me that they more than likely will come to a deal with him hopefully on the day we all go to court because he denied the first option they gave him and that‚Äôs why he plead not guilty. Either way I‚Äôm just praying that on this date he just takes whatever they give him, whether it‚Äôs mandated therapy/counseling, community service, a fine, I don‚Äôt care. I really just hope that this doesn‚Äôt continue on because I‚Äôm stressing out about it already, I‚Äôm running through all the possible scenarios in my head if this man lies and says he never put his hands on me.

is this domestic violence?,9,"One time during sex my ex-boyfriend slapped me really hard I had to stop what I was doing and started crying. He comforted me in that moment, later he told me he was angry I wasn't doing what I was doing well enough and he wanted to motivate me. He would hit me during sex and I was usually ok with it but the force of that slap and his explanation made me uncomfortable. In another instance, he told me ""I was so angry I wanted to break your jaw"" because I messed up something during sex. He said he was just angry in general and that he wanted to hit something and I happened to be in front of him. When I told him I was uncomfortable around him after he said that he said I had no reason because he never actually hit me in a violent way.

Should I leave?,2,"Hi all, 
I‚Äôm new to this community and finally got the courage to post here. As a mental health professional (currently on hiatus to heal!) I hope to destigmatize mental health professionals who seek help in posting this. We‚Äôre most often wounded helpers and that‚Äôs what draws us into the field! 
A little of my background: 
I grew up in a very religious, evangelical home. I was sexually abused very young by a grandparent and emotionally, psychologically abused at times by my mother. She always singled me out because I was outspoken( and my sister, too) but worshiped the boys. I was kept homeschooled and barely had an education. Not sure how I got into and passed college and graduate school. Guess I had an angel looking out for me! Anyway, 2 years ago I entered into a romantic relationship with the love of my life. We had 8months of peace until my narc-sociopathic mom got in the way. She threatened to harm me if I stayed with him, so we immediately hid our relationship and have stayed hidden since. Now, we are engaged in secret and have managed to rent a home states away from where I currently live. We‚Äôd be far enough where no one could ever find me! And I‚Äôd finally be free!! My heart wants to run out of this house next month but the other part of me feels scared to just up and leave with no goodbye or giving any type of warning. If I were to say that I‚Äôm still with him, it could put me and my sister in danger. I‚Äôm hoping she can get a job she just interviewed for and then be able to leave ASAP. I feel really torn because if I leave in March, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll have regret on ‚Äúnot trying‚Äù even if they‚Äôre people who didn‚Äôt deserve it. It‚Äôs caused a lot of conflict in my relationship to my fianc√©. I‚Äôm so scared that staying is continuing to make me lose time with him and lose more and more of my freedom. But I can‚Äôt help but feel responsible/ self-blame for the massive blow up that is about to occur when I leave with or without a warning. (Especially since I never leave this damn house!) I‚Äôm going to meet my fianc√© next week and begin slipping my stuff out under the guise of donations. The only thing I would need for the day of is my cat! My fear is just leaving my sister behind. She doesn‚Äôt want to relocate states away with us and that‚Äôs where I feel concerned. I‚Äôve thought of her and I staying with a friend and then once I know she is safe (and won‚Äôt return home out of guilt or manipulation!) I can travel to the rented house with my fianc√©. I‚Äôm just scared if she doesn‚Äôt get employed how she will care for herself when I‚Äôm states away. I‚Äôm also just feeling guilty and self blaming if I leave solo and run off. Any advice on what I should do??",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Abuser got arrested,12,"It‚Äôs been awhile since I posted here. I got out of this physically abusive relationship almost two years ago now. From the noise complaints we got, to me being flung back and forth into walls and onto the floor, choking me until I could not breathe and flinging me into full blown mental breakdowns (I‚Äôm bipolar 2) I only ever called the police once, and on my last straw. A drunken fight that escalated to a physical point where he stormed out of MY apartment. I called my good friend and 911. I wrote everything down that happened to me in the statement over the course of the year we were together, I showed them photos I had taken every time he bruised me. my good friend at the time stood there and added to the story of things I told her that I left out. Maybe about a few weeks after this incident I finally broke up with him and was able to break my apartment lease with no issue. We still communicated for over a year after we broke up, I think he was trying to manipulate me in other ways so I wouldn‚Äôt tell anybody, or do anything to ‚Äúruin him‚Äù lol I always thought that was funny, he is a 28 year old with no stable income who was abusing a fresh 21 year old, what was there to ruin, nothing ever began. Anyways, I cut ties with my ex fully end of November 2020, I already had distanced myself a lot last year thanks to covid but we still communicated. Today I woke up to a text message from an unknown number just my luck it‚Äôs him telling me he needs to speak to me about something important, and that we can‚Äôt ‚Äútext‚Äù about it. He calls me, and tells me he was arrested for battery and that he‚Äôs in therapy and getting help and he asked me if I‚Äôm proceeding with anything? Proceeding? I had no idea they even arrested him, I completely forgot I even wrote statement lol, either way it was really an amazing feeling to hear he got arrested. I really hope the state charges him because honestly they haven‚Äôt contacted me at all, maybe they have enough evidence from that night? I‚Äôm not sure. He tried to apologize to me and I cut the convo quickly, I said ‚Äúwell that sucks, thanks for letting me know‚Äù and I hung up. I dealt with that pretty well I think? I feel like this is victim tampering on his part LOL. Either way I hope he rots. I told a few friends and my mom everyone was happy for me, I‚Äôm gonna tell my boyfriend as well! I‚Äôve been doing so much better and I‚Äôm in therapy, I‚Äôm so happy and I can feel myself healing. Time is a beautiful thing, and so is justice.",TW Physical Violence
Update: Last Sunday a mutual friend of ours grabbed me by the neck and through me down his staircase while my wife egged him on... (TW: Gore),8,"I did end up going to the hospital. At 5 am in the morning I snuck down into the bathroom, turned the fan on and quietly contacted my insurance company to see which local hospital would accept them. He emailed me a list of hospitals and I summoned an uber, waiting in the dark around 5, 5:15 am. About two minutes before the Uber came, my wife started screaming at me, telling me to come back to bed. I lied and told her that I was playing on my iPad. I had tried to be quiet, but I had wanted to gather some spare clothes or something. I think it was me opening the top shelf to get a pair of socks that woke her up. Fuck socks. (I ended up going without them.)

When the uber came, I unlocked the door and bolted with what few things I could secret out. I didn't have time to lock the door behind me.

The advising physician told me that I had experienced a ""medium sized"" concussion five days ago, but that it was too late to do anything about it. The MRI revealed no internal bleeding at the moment. They told me to go home at around 11 am, and I returned to the house. I do not know how I will afford the MRI, or even the modest deductible.

This week has been very bad. I feel like my body is unwinding. I am afraid I might die. The bruising is coming in.

This morning I woke up at 6:30 am barely able to move on my right side. At around 8:30 am I took a shower, and saw one of the nastier bruises. I am afraid it is not getting better.

I woke her up and asked her to take a look. She looked and me and said, ""I don't see any bruising."" I pointed at the bruise on my side, and she said, ""Oh that? You woke me up for that?"" and rolled over and went back to sleep.

Later on, around 11:30 am, I was trying to do some online banking and having some trouble logging on. She started screaming at me again. I told her to ""Shut the fuck up"", which I thought would make me feel better, but didn't. She said, ""God, ever since that one time, you've been so fucking nasty. Just get over it already. I'm sorry you're a fucking retard.""

\*Edit\* The moderators made me take down the picture of the bruise. Obviously it is very large with a dark black nucleus, spreading out into a larger purple ring. I would say it is  \~12"" in diameter or so. \*End Edit\* Am I taking crazy pills? How could she not see that?",TW Physical Violence
I just called the cops,4,"My boyfriend of 2yrs was great to start with, then he started being emotionally and verbally abusive. After a few months of keeping me up all night berating me, calling me names, accusing me of being a slut then apologizing and love bombing me the violence started. Obviously I should have left then, but i didn't. He has a 16yo daughter who lives with him part time and I always made sure to keep all his abuse from her because he guilt tripped me that he would lose custody. 
Well after 3 months of beatings i finally locked him out and agreed to see him if he went to therapy.  Honestly therapy changed our lives. It was like the first few months again, all sunshine and love bombs, but then he stopped going. Him and his daughter moved in with me a couple months ago and it's been a bit... tense. His daughter can be difficult and this week I finally lost it and yelled at her that she needed to treat me with respect and not like her servent. He didn't really back me up but he did eventually make her apologize and explained what behavior is expected of her.
  Anyway tonight he wanted to have sex and I didn't. This triggered an argument and he tried to choke me. I finally got the courage to call the cops, so obviously his daughter knows now. She didn't see the abuse and he immediately started on the ""look at this psycho, pretending I hit her. She does this to control me, she's always been like this, shes a psycho"". When the cops escorted him out she went with him. I guess I don't really know what advise I want, I just wanted to talk to someone who knows what it's like. He will be painting me as crazy to his daughter and to whatever friend they have gone to stay with. And because I yelled at her they will probably believe him.
 I own my own house but he does loads of practical stuff that it will be hard for me to figure out. Oh and I've got a 6mo puppy and no car and I travel heaps for work so I don't know what I'm going to do about that. Most of our friends are mutual friends so I feel a bit alienated and I'm worried they'll believe him not me. I also feel super guilty because it might have implications for his custody of his daughter.

Is filing a police report good enough? I don't think I should press charges.,4,"I used to be friends with this one dude, 3 weeks ago we got into a physical fight.

Almost time to go and I'm having crazy anxiety,3,"I haven't been approved for my apartment yet but I get the deposit back if I'm denied so there's really no downside here.

This would be an extreme coincidence but the repercussions of him finding me at an apartment on my lunch break would be great. I keep feeling afraid that he knows someone who lives there and they will tell him they saw me there.

"I PHONED THE POLICE ON MY PARTNER (NOW EX) AND I DON‚ÄôT KNOW IF I SHOULD RETRACT MY STATEMENT, looking for advice",22,"
My partner and I had been together two years. In May, we had been arguing so much that he pulled me by my arms and tried to force me out his house after midnight, it resulted in him leaving. We split up for four weeks after that and I started talking to someone online to help me feel better. I do regret this but speaking to someone kept me distracted from the heartbreak. 

During the breakup, I received over 100 whats apps, many missed calls, texts, bank transfers and emails asking for me back. Long story short, we got back together and I politely let down the guy I was speaking to online. 

In August, my partner found out I had spoken to someone. He tried to pull me out the house again by my arms. I left. The next day, he showed up at my house with a baseball bat demanding this guys contact details. Long story short, he phoned him threatening him which resulted in this guy making a complaint to the police and the police showing up at my partners door. During this, I got several messages calling me a slut, a slag and everything else. I literally just spoke to him when we split up. He messaged me hours later saying... ‚Äúok, I‚Äôm over it now, can we go back to normal baby‚Äù And yet again, vulnerable me went back because I was so in love. 

3/4 weeks later, he got drunk and was telling me I was such a slut, he couldn‚Äôt believe I would betray him like this, that he‚Äôs went behind my back and done worse and that I‚Äôll never know about it and I should never underestimate him. I also had a drink in me, I ran away from him and hid behind a tree because he was being so nasty. He found me and his disgusting words still continued. He said something outrageous that he was going to sleep with someone else whilst I‚Äôm on holiday so I turned round and slapped him across the face (I should have never have done that but I was so hurt and it happened so fast) after I slapped him he kicked me as hard as he could and I fell to the ground, i army crawled to try and get away from him. The bruise on my thigh was as big as his size 12 foot shoe print. I could hardly walk for week. He apologised- I took him back (again) writing this out has just made me realise how pathetic I was. 

After this, there was about 10+ occasions where if we were arguing he would put his full hand over my mouth and squeeze and tell me to shut the fuck up. He did this one time in bed after he pinned me down. This was ongoing and there‚Äôs been other occasions where he‚Äôs done the whole pulling me out the house, I‚Äôve just lost count. 

Two weeks ago, we were arguing about something so trivial which resulted in hun grabbing me and forcing me on the couch, grabbing my mouth to shut me up and pulling me off the couch to get me out, this time he pulled me right off the couch and I span round and hit my back on the floor. I had enough and I phoned the police, I hung up straight away as I got scared. He got up and told me to get out his way, I kept trying to stop him, crying, telling him I‚Äôll fix this please don‚Äôt leave, and he cornered me up in the bathroom and kept yelling ‚Äúyou want me to hit you, you want me to hurt you, get out my way before I do something‚Äù I was just crying telling him I love him and I‚Äôm sorry for phoning the police and he pushed me with both hands into the bath, I managed to stop my head hitting against the tiles. At that point I was hyperventilating and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. 

Fast forward, I gave the police my statement. He‚Äôs been to court and pleaded not guilty but the prosecutor fiscal is taking it all the way and I now have to go to court in June to give evidence. His bail conditions are not to contact me or come near me. 

I‚Äôve been feeling so guilty for phoning the police on him and what might happen to his future. 

Do I retract my statement so that his consequences aren‚Äôt as serious? I don‚Äôt know what to do, I want to feel anger but I just don‚Äôt quite yet üò• 

ADVICE PLEASE",TW Physical Violence
26f I have 4 kids with 31m what do I do???,3,"So we have been together for almost 9 years and have 4 children together.

We met and got together when I was 17. I was a ""troubled teen"", adopted and abused by adoptive parents, getting into fights, cutting myself.

‚Äã

I had gotten pregnant and had my first child at 15. My adoptive mother is a narcissist. She basically stole me from my biological mother and alienated me and is doing the same with my daughter. I dealt with the abuse for 2 more years and left with my friends to my future S/O's hometown.

‚Äã

I was pretty lonely and so was he. He was 22 years old when we got together. We were inseparable, not lovey-dovey, but probably more of a codependent type.

‚Äã

The first time anything physical happened, I was having a moment because I was highly insecure and thought he wanted someone better. I was still 17. Anyways he walked in on me cutting myself and he snatched me up by my hair. ""You stupid fuckin bitch"" I heard as I watched strands of my hair fall from his hands. (When we talk about this incident, he says violence is what he saw in movies in response to suicidal behaviors).

‚Äã

Anyways, most of our relationship has been up and down. The ups were very high, and the downs were lower than low. somehow in between all of this, we thought it would be a good idea to start a family. he told me he wanted 4 kids. I was so naive I just wanted a family and didn't think of potential incompatibilities down the line.

‚Äã

One of our biggest issues is my insecurity. He hasn't ""cheated"" but he has lied about things like who he found attractive, or who he slept with when we weren't together. It doesnt matter that these things happened, but I am so angry that he would even lie to me. Any shortcoming I've had, like talking to guys online, sending photos, i told him right away. 99.9% of the times I've done that, it was to get him to try harder. Never worked.

‚Äã

I also have OCD, so it makes me ask him for reassurance constantly. It sucks.

‚Äã

Our other huge problem in this is his inability to keep a job. I have paid rent, bills, everything for our children, birthdays, christmas, valentine's days. he doesn't mind if his family goes without. We have lived in shelters, and if we dont make rent next month, he said he is willing to go back. He smokes weed and cigarettes every day. If I dont buy it, there will be an issue. not violence, but guilt trips, pouting, and letting my kids know mommy made daddy sad.

‚Äã

It used to be full on brawls every day. Even through all my pregnancies. I don't know why I stayed. During my last pregnancy, we were into it physically. He slammed me on my belly and said he didn't care if I lost the baby. He held me down by my throat on the kitchen floor by the sink. The harder he pushed, the tighter the seal when my throat seemingly shut. It felt like my throat was closed. I couldn't get a voice out. Just some sort of ""vibration"". while that was happening, I was flailing, kicking, and blacking out more and more. I was scratching his body trying to break skin just to get him off of me. I even tried to rip off his private part. i thought i was dying! Pregnant and dying like this? Eventually I stopped fighting back and my body went limp. My 3 year old son said, ""mommy no!"" and his daddy said, ""mommy needs to die"".

‚Äã

When the cops got there, I refused to ""snitch"" on my man. I understood him. the cops said they saw the strangulation marks. I still denied it. They found him across the street. He told them, that I out of nowhere, went crazy and started scratching him. I was arrested for domestic battery/domestic abuse. I have that on record, preventing me from getting any career in psychology, my passion.

‚Äã

After that incident, I went to a domestic abuse womens shelter. I was without my children for 17 days. Within a week, he had another girl in my bed. The bed our babies used to climb into every morning.he hadn't even changed the sheets. My dna was still on there. I knew the girl too.

‚Äã

After I got my children back through calling CPS for them to compare us, we found a place to live. Their dad, got engaged to an old acquaintance of ours. I cried every day. he was so cold. I once cried to him on the phone. He said if I didnt stop, he would hang up because I'm making him sick to his stomach. During the 6 months we were apart, he didnt call his kids a lot.he only saw them 3 times. I never ever sweated him. I wasnt going to beg.

‚Äã

So we got back together. We talked about my insecurities and if we could be 100% honest to each other. We agreed on that. Before the 6 months, we broke up for about 3 months. this was 5 years ago. During that time, after about 2 months, I slept with someone. My s/o has been giving me hell for this. Now, just 7 months ago, I found out he slept with someone when we broke up for the 3 months. a friend of mine! I'm like omg..how am i ever going to trust him?

‚Äã

The trust thing ruins everything. What's even worse is he is now alienating our children against me. They have seen him hit me, and told me I was lying to my face. I couldn't believe it.

‚Äã

I have been self employed doing things like writing novels, tarot cards(natural gift, not just for money), and I have been very successful. However, he is not happy for my success.

‚Äã

I've recently reconnected with a childhood friend. He is single. never been a player. not my usual type. but he encourages me to better myself. he tells me what I'm good at without me having to showcase for him. He is trying to do so much for me. My self esteem and motivation to be alive is much stronger after I met with him. We sat at his place for 7 hours just talking about anything and everything.

‚Äã

Anyways, i do not know what to do. I am afraid to break up my family. But I know as a human being I deserve more. I dont even get the bare minimum. I dont mean money either. I mean support.

Relationship lasted 10 months. We broke up 4 months ago. 
Randomly he calls me the morning of Valentine‚Äôs Day and asks me to pick him up from a mental institution after his discharge.. he spent 7 days. I picked him up, read his summaries and he‚Äôs been diagnosed with mild schizophrenia.. I‚Äôve noticed narcissistic traits. 
We got into an argument during our last interaction. It ended with very noticeable bruises, sores throughout my body. This has been the second time he‚Äôs left a bruise, first time he twisted my wrist because of a cell phone. Very apologetic ‚Äúaccident‚Äù. 
This time he had no remorse in his eyes while slamming me against the car door. He wouldn‚Äôt let me drive away, threw me on the ground. We fought and I finally drove off. 
Other than these two instances he has NEVER laid his hands on me. 
Should I just say forget this and continue with zero contact? Or confront him? Truthfully I don‚Äôt feel safe with him.

Fear of losing my existence due to Domestic Violence,5,"Hello!

I am a 20f from the UK (originally from Spain) and I have lived in London for a few years. I currently work from home with an amazing company. 

Last year I have met a person I briefly dated who later turned out to be a very difficult person. He has assaulted me a couple of times, beating me up, strangulating and throwing me over. He has made numerous threats to kill and threats about how I can‚Äôt tell police.

It took me many months but with much support I have since spoken out although I still struggle with whether this is the right thing to do or not, how to trust the police, etc.. the list of worries is endless.

One of my main concerns is that due to the current reoccurring assaults I have so far needed to take 4 unexpected sick days from work. 2 consecutive days earlier this month in February and currently I am taking two days off again, since my most recent assault resulted in Hospital stay.

The company mentioned during my first unexpected two days off, that everyone has personal matters going on in their life and that they felt it was unprofessional of me to be affected by it so much that it affected work. They have denied the pay rise they had considered due to the lack of balance between work and personal life and I worry that these new two days now coming up will eventually lead to an end of my future with this company. I genuinely love working for them and I really don‚Äôt want to loose them. Partially also because I will struggle to find a new occupation, may struggle with rent and end up having to leave the UK, which in return could end up making me loose my settled status and it would all go really south from there.

I have expressed my thoughts on not needing two days off, but they did however urge me to take an extra day to sort things out. I keep telling them that I love my job and I want to do all I can to continue unaffected. My KPI‚Äôs and general work is far above average, I always do 130% 

I still worry about the original comments that have been made and that this will affect my future negatively. It stresses me out a lot. Police, medical professionals and my victim support all say that it would be outrageous for them to not be supportive but genuinely the company is really being very vague. I know that they have no idea what to expect from how much this is going to impact the next months as this investigation could take awhile but it‚Äôs really difficult to not have any reassurance whatsoever.

Can't discern,2,"Topic between me (34/f) and bf (22/m) was about vaping versus cigarettes. Both agree both are bad. Backstory, He has an opinion that he doesn't want the Covid vaccine bc ""it's people being used as guinea pigs""

I took a hit from his vape and thought my lungs were going to explode. Told him ""you said the vaccines make people guinea pigs, how long has vaping been around? I'd think you're more of a guinea pig with vaping (for recreation vs medical resolution) since it hasn't been around for very long"".. he constantly wants to attribute vaping facts as the big tobacco company's agenda. 

Sorry, what's the agenda of vaping? Both parties major concern isn't to make money? Ok then..

living in fear,1,"he getting out of jail on March 9, I'm scared of facing my addiction to him, I have suffered many years of abuse from him. my mind raced with the thought of what's going to happen when he gets home? do I live in fear ? or do I live with my head high and act like nothing bother me ? in reality I shiver with fear every time I think about him and everything that happened the last twenty year on and off with 3kids later. I wanted the fairy tale story he was going to change because he loved the kid and I. i suffer from PTSD from him. I have suffered emotional abuse, to the point where I almost really did kill myself. I loved him so much I couldn't take the man I love saying horrible things about me. it killed me inside to think the man I loved thought I was this disgusting whore that should die I believe were the words he said to me. he also told me he didn't care if I lived or died I tried using drugs to kill myself. I survived all those moments now I'm ready after 20 years I'm ready to fight my addiction to him. I fought the addiction to drugs. I have struggled to get my life back it is hard after everything I have been through with him.I live in fear of what's going to happen. he seriously hurt me this time really tried breaking my neck.

I left him and I‚Äôm not looking back.,9,"On Wednesday before V Day, he left the house angry, and came home angrier and drunker than when he left.  

I tried to de escalate him at least five times. He screamed and cursed at me to go sleep downstairs. I did, because I was scared and threatened. I didn‚Äôt want him to wake our 3yo. I recorded it and I listen to remind myself I did the right thing. 

I was shaking when I went to the basement apartment, and locked the door. It felt like I was under siege. I will never forget that fight or flight feeling. The stress acid in my stomach is still in the taste of my mouth. I‚Äôve lost so much weight in covid - everyone is getting fat except me. 

I spoke to a lawyer referred by a friend, charged an Airbnb to a credit card and dropped off two bags. I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd actually go there. But figured, why not. Just in case of another BIG fight. 

But WHY was I waiting for the big fight to happen? I was on the fence because I was scared. What‚Äôs more scary than living with a maniac though?

He blocks my body from moving through the house we own 50/50, body checked me once when I was holding our daughter, and shoved me 3 weeks ago. He fights in the car and it‚Äôs scary because he‚Äôs driving erratically. The abuse is almost entirely emotional and verbal and it‚Äôs not ok. Why wait around for broken bones or a black eye. I needed to stop collecting red flags. 

It wasn‚Äôt the first time he came home drunk. Abuse survivors know this. The name calling, gaslighting (you‚Äôre too sensitive/I was joking/you must be on your period/can you take a joke/etc). I keep an LJ and it‚Äôs been happening since 2015. I also read that to remind myself. 

I am a lucky to have a car, a job, and a bank account. 

I secretly saved my own pay because he watches every penny - plus we had a joint account. I wish I saved more but whatever, I‚Äôm F R E E. 

To the survivors out there: you can do it. Too many people stay and protect their abuser. My husband‚Äôs mother was abused horribly by her husband. We know where he learned it from and how it‚Äôs been normalized   for him. 

I gathered every ounce of courage I had, grabbed my kid, and left him while he was on a work call. 6 days after he came home horribly abusive and drunk. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to keep dwelling in the past.  I‚Äôve got a lawyer, therapist, and am starting peer counseling. The court is (slowly, due to Covid) going to serve him divorce papers. 

I‚Äôve got my daughter and filed a good cause report with the DA‚Äôs office so I wouldn‚Äôt be charged with kidnapping. I was also afraid of being charged with abandonment if I left without her, but I‚Äôd never do that. She‚Äôs too precious. 

It‚Äôs child abuse to verbally assault me in front of her. 

I called him from a Safeway parking lot to tell him I left him and that he can contact me on the talking parents app (thanks Reddit!). You know what he said?

‚ÄúBut...We have such a great relationship!  Oh you‚Äôre just being sensitive, come back. You know I didn‚Äôt mean it. You‚Äôre over reacting. Are you on your period? I love you. How could you do this to our family.‚Äù

I have called the police,3,"I am a ]25y] female that has recently moved to another country to live with my ex-boyfriend [35y].  At the beginning of the relationship I did't notice any red flags until,  he started to shout at me during argunents. I've repeately told him to lower his voice, but without success. During one of the arguments he didn't lower his voice and I've began to shout,too. One moment after he put his hands around my neck, and told me to calm down. Last time, I told him that I will call the police if he continues to grab my neck. 
Of course, during this time, we had more and more fights, I wanted to break up with him multiple times, but he always told me that we will get through.
One month ago, our house has been flooded and we had to move to a temporary place.
The stress, of COVID19, while being unemployed (because I finished University 5 months ago and I am in the process of getting my documents ) not seeing my family, not having friends, being flooded and having little money has really got me.
Yesterday, he wanted to reconciliate and he said that he finally understood what he did wrong.
We drank, I almost passed out from alcohol while he ignored me during this time I wanted to get some sleep, hut he was talking loudly on the phone, not giving me a peace of mind.
I have to admit, I started to shout loud and I said bad things and after he put his hands around my neck and after when I looked in the mirror ai saw some blood coming from the lips.
I called the police. Police came and took him away and they said that he is not allowed to sleep in the house during that night.
This morning he came into the house and he asked me when I will move out because everything is over.
Now I can think off 3 things:
1. to move out asap and be willing to pay the rent for 6 months.
2. to go back home and stay there until I have everything in order 

The problem is that I have to recieve some important documents this week and I have to stay at this place.
He said that he will not touch me,but I am afraid of him.
I have to say that I live in the UK.

Last Sunday a mutual friend of ours grabbed me by the neck and through me down his staircase while my wife egged him on...,6,"We are in our mid-30's and have been married for about a year and half. We rent an apartment together.

I don't really remember what happened. But one second one of our mutual friends was screaming at me about not reading the Stranger by Camus. And my wife was cackling, ""he doesn't read. he doesn't read."" And then he grabbed me by the neck and threw me down the stairs of his apartment.

I hit my right temple really bad on the bannister of the staircase. I've had a very difficult time concentrating. I just regained full motor control of my right arm. I am still limping on my right hip.

This morning I woke up and said ""where am I?"" as the first thing I said to her. She told me to ""stop pretending, and that I had to go to work."" I was confused, but eventually found my phone. It was 7:30 am. I didn't have to work until 9.

At this point in our relationship she has told me to kill myself three times. She has poured vodka on my head while I was sleeping twice. If I don't lie motionless in bed next to her she will start screaming. Sometimes I will sneak down into the bathroom downstairs, always careful to avoid the squeaky step. I never really realized how shitty the creaky step could be. It's the third one on the way down, but if you hop from two to four, that's even louder. Honestly, my life would be a lot better if I could get some grease or something to make it as silent as possible. I will lock myself in the bathroom and just play mindless games on my ipad. She usually wakes up after about a half an hour to 45 minutes of me sitting in the bathroom. Then the yelling starts.

One time, I was trying to hide underneath the blankets, and she threw a shelf at my face. I tried to block it with my arms. Then she threw another metal tray laying on top of my bookcase. I managed to block that with my other arm but did end up with significant lacerations/bruising on my upper arms.

In the morning when I woke up, I asked her if she wanted to talk to about the incident and she responded, ""I didn't think you'd remember."" And then walked away.

I took pictures of the bruising. She found out about their existence through a mutual friend, and then she made me delete them. She claimed I was being abusive by having them. She forced me to delete them. Luckily I was able to quickly deep fake them in an obscure email subfolder. I hope she never looks into what files are contained in the ""Fun Summer Road Trip 2011"" folder in my email. I've started screen shooting texts telling me I'm a failure, selfish, careless, lazy, a drunk etc.

Today I told her that I got a really good performance review at my statistics job. And she told me I was too lazy to ever do well. It really felt bad that she seems to believe that I could never be good at anything.

I told her I was thinking of leaving her, and she laughed at me and told me that I am too poor. Which is probably true.

I tried to stay with an old high school friend, but I felt like I was a burden on her and her boyfriend. It was nice that at least she seemed to believe me. It's weird. I showed the bruising folders to my father, and he just did not respond and basically said he did want to get involved in my relationship with her. Nobody will honestly talk to me about this issue. They just look away, and mumble something and then change the topic.

She also likes destroying my property. Like my security badge which I need to do my job. Or my computer, which again is job related. And because she is the primary account holder for our internet provider, she has this weird app where she can turn off my internet. I think they designed it so you could convince your rowdy teenager to come to dinner, or at least that's what the advertisements claim. I don't think it was meant as a means of control over your husband.

I was thinking about getting a secret savings account. The goal would be to have enough in it to pay for one months rent and a security deposit. That's the plan, but it's hard.

It's getting worse and not better. It's spiraling. I guess I would just like somebody to listen to me, or ready this, and acknowledge that it happened.

I feel like I‚Äôm seeking validation for my feelings.,9,"I left my ex early to mid December. We were not together very long, but things had moved very fast. We were living together within a few months of meeting each other, and our little arguments quickly escalated. 

There were a couple of times he stepped in front of me to keep me from leaving a room. In one of those instances I tried to push past him, but he grabbed me and threw me back to where I was standing. Another time he pulled me into him and grabbed me by the hair on the back of my head. He started kissing me with quick and hard pecks, yelling at me in between them. There were other small things that happened, grabbing me by my arm when I try to walk away, always in my face during arguments, endless threats, but he never hit me. 

I guess I feel as if I overreacted because he never actually hit me. When he found out I was upset about the things he had done, he said I should have told him how I felt. He acted like he had done nothing wrong. I still don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. I‚Äôm crawling out of my skin trying to justify my feelings to myself.",TW Physical Violence
Afraid husband will fight no contact order claiming abuse from me,11,"I left my husband last week after I noticed his behavior changing since I began struggling financially. When we dated he had gotten on top of me and covered my face so that I couldn‚Äôt breath, physically restrained me, and threw me onto the floor all on separate occasions. When I left that time he tried to sue me for rent money but the case was thrown out because I had photos of bruises. 

His behavior the past couple of months started escalating where he‚Äôd put all his weight on me and wouldn‚Äôt get off unless I gave him a kiss or if I tried to shove him off he‚Äôd say I was being aggressive. He is now harassing me about rent money (I‚Äôve gone no contact) he sent me a ridiculous agreement to sign and I told him I‚Äôm not signing it because first off I have no money due to him financially draining me, it also said nothing about removing my name from the lease (yet he wants me to send my key back), and that I left for a reason I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm legally bound to the lease and if my credit gets screwed up, I want nothing to do with him or the apartment. I knew after I left he‚Äôd begin with stalking behavior which he has never had an Instagram but the other day it suggested I should follow a new account that has his specific nickname. I was also walking my dog when I saw a car slow down and then speed up that was just like his, I couldn‚Äôt see the license plate, but my mom was able to find the clip on her Ring. After I refused to sign the agreement he included in his response ‚Äúwe will see what the judge says this time with my photos and evidence‚Äù. I dug my nails into him one of the times that he refused to get off of me and he took playfully took photos, the other evidence is when I was going through a miscarriage and swatted my hand at him after him telling me I can‚Äôt have kids because I‚Äôm cursed by God and that I‚Äôm going to hell, he began filming me saying I attacked him and was crazy and a demon. This is what I‚Äôm most nervous about because I did attempt to backhand his arm when he said this.
The night before I left the final straw was him blocking me from leaving a room twice and then claiming I pushed him when I squeezed past him to go lock myself in the other room. I could see he was trying to force me into positions where he‚Äôd say I was abusive when I tried to defend myself. He‚Äôs always said if I ever call the police on him he‚Äôd claim he was acting in self defense. The week before I left he thought it was funny to point a loaded AK 47 type of gun at the cats, when I asked him to stop he said the safety was on and that they liked it bc they were sniffing it. 

I really don‚Äôt know if any of his behaviors will matter in court but I did not attack him in the way he is making it sound. I am not the abuser and the last time I tried to get a not contact through my school they retracted it after he called and said I was just trying to get out of paying rent money. I have spoken with an attorney and am getting a no contact order but I know he will try to bring this up against me.

Girlfriend has been extremely physically abusive toward me. How to disengage (very long),11,"Started off in Late 2019 in what I thought was a good relationship, things went really well between us really connected, we made future plans. In April we moved in together, and I really helped her a lot with her life. She just came out of what she claimed was an abusive relationship and divorce (7 year arranged marriage). I was helping her exercise and lose weight, and I'd catch her lying on these stupid things that nobody should lie about (going into my medications and taking some vitamin). I'd talk about how lying to each other is totally unacceptable. Lying upsets me. I'd put my heart and soul into motivating her like when she had trouble with a job (arguing with some guy), I helped her see the bigger picture and develop strategies. She used to scream louder than anyone could ever imagine to the point where all the neighbors could hear, and it got me worried and super rattled. She also had this pattern of packing her bags whenever we had a disagreement. I wasn't used to this, and talked to her about it, the screaming kept intensifying. I cared about her and I thought it had to do with trauma in her abuse, but still it was hard for me to say ""you need to leave"" and stick by it because I cared about her and us. Physical abuse slowly creeped in, at first it was throwing stuff at me, or trying to slap me. Though by September it devolved into a pattern, she'd point her finger at me and yell, and then swing at me when we were having a disagreement. She'd blame me for everything wrong in her life.  The day after I recognized she needed a life saving surgery and got her to the ED (I'm a medical professional), she gave me a black eye, punched and scratched my back. A few days later she did the same thing. Only thing I did was hold her hands so she couldnt hit me. It felt so bad and dehumanizing to be in this situation, having to hold my partner like this. I thought what has my life become?

One time at the mall, she was arguing aggressively with a cashier because she couldn't make an online return. Probably would have gotten called security on her, so i stepped in and said ""look she cant do the return I'll take care of it by phone easily"". She saw me as my ex-husband and started berating me in public. I told her ""you're acting like a (bitter) divorced women"". Her reaction? Run around the mall and scream like someone was murdering her. It was so gross. I calmly tried to talk to her, and people at the mall saw her screaming and automatically assumed I was some sort of aggressor. I remained incredibly calm the entire time and patient, even after talking to mall security. By this point I've spent numerous occasion working with her to understand the root of her behavior, why we can't raise kids in violence, and how this hurts us and breaks the trust. All these months of yelling wore down on me and even though I was for the most part calm, it became hard not to yell and isolate myself.

In october she threw a plate at my laptop, and cracked the trackpad in an argument. She thankfully replaced that. In November, she got mad at me and treated me like garbage for asking her to assist me with something, and because she wanted to rush me so we could go out and do something. I tried to talk through this it got nowhere. She kept putting down my masculinity and insisting she was right, and insulting me. It bothered me so much I woke up in the middle of the night, and was so angry and frustrated I told her to just get out. She sits on the bed and starts yelling and swearing at me, and I say no. Just pack the bags and leave. I help her pick up one suitcase and she locks me out of the guest house naked and calls the cops. I have to run to the main house and find a spare key, and get dressed. We both said there was no physical abuse, but wow that was scary. I could have had my life ruined.

In January, she finds out she accidentally didnt renew her visa, and I say that if we cant be together physically ever, we can't continue this relationship, but I'll help you get it filled. That night I had a hamburger I kissed her as a joke (she's hindu), and she comes over to kiss me on the eye. I put my  tongue in her mouth to make out as usual, and she bites through my tongue. All the way through I could feel my finger on both sides of my tongue. Im incredibly freaked out but I keep very quiet because my elderly parents are around and they dont need more stress. I tell her to just go. Shoot what am I going to do? I go over with her and called her a bad word and she kicks and punches me. I go upstairs and pace back and forth. I look at my tongue and I'm freaked because it looks really bad.  I keep thinking about next steps.

I go back to where my parents, and I go over to my mom and quietly pull her aside and ask her to take a look without explaining, then I slowly explain what happened. About halfway through girlfriend comes over and says ""I knew you'd fucking tell them because you're a momma's boy pussy"". My mom says something, and girlfriend gets this evil look in her eyes and charges toward my mom with her fist raised and says ""I will kill you"". I of course got between them, so nothing would happen. Got gf out of the house. shes on the lawn and waiting by the front door with a psychotic look in her eyes, and i'm trying to keep my parents safe from her. Who knows what shes going to do? I have her come with me to the ER to address the mistake she made and shes treating me like garbage the entire time. The Doc says I dont need stitches, and her response ""That's all? what a waste of time. I bet you wanted to manipulate me"".  I couldn't believe it.  She also sends my parents some threatening texts about how she'll never leave the house.

At this point, I'm just trying to get her out of the house as step 1 of closing this chapter on her, which I do manage to do after a trip to atlanta. I was still blinded my feelings, and I did help her move out into a new place. She gets even more manipulative and cunning though throwing me out after I take a sleeping medicine (putting my life in dangerous) because i bring up going to play golf with my parents the next day calmly. She throws me out and then tells me later that she called an emergency psychiatrist and felt suicidal because I left. She decides to make a one way flight to india in mid march and at this point I'm just slowly ebbing away contact from her. She claims she'll come back and wants me to come to marry her, but I'm never doing that.  She keeps trying to crawl back in my life after she did this, trashed me to her entirely family, and part of me is worried that she will come up with a bogus story of physical abuse against me (she has also hit herself in the head and nose during arguments really hard, and I had to stop her from doing that).

She has absolutely no remorse for any of the times she hit me, none of the discussions we had mattered because she did the same physical abuse on christmas, and she never took accountability for what she did to my mom. She justifies everything she does in her mind, and twists everything around. She warped the situation with the biting through my tongue and tried to make the real issue that I told my parents. She also created an environment of terror at my own house for months, where I was honestly afraid to come home, and what she would do next.  I've known I've deserved better than this, but I really loved and trusted this girl for far too long. What should I do? I'm really hoping she'll just leave and never come back. I was really naive to this abuse, but I'm pretty sure this a pattern of hers in all her relationships.",TW Physical Violence
He strangled me will he change?,34,"Hi all I've never done this before. I'm really looking for some advice. I have been with my partner for nearly 8 years. I'm 27 he's 36. I was very younge when I met him and he was amazing and I quickly fell in love with him and him me. About a year into the relationship we had a argument (can't remember what about) he was trying to get me out of his flat but I refused as I wanted to sort things out. He then pinned me up against the wall and strangled me. After he calmed down he was very sorry and I accepted the apology and he said he would never do that again. 7 years later I can sadly say that simular situations during arguments have happened at least another 6 times over the years most recently in the Autumn so a few months back now. Hes strangled me almost every time, pinned me up against the wall and has slapped me plus all of the awful names I am called ( bitch, hoe, retard) I never fight back or swear I just about raise my voice. I've always known that this is bad and not normal however I think over the years I have become very good at ignoring and blanking out the truth. Since turning 26/27 I've been doing alot of research on domestic violence and have accepted that I am a victim. I wouldn't say that I am your typical victim as most of the time our relationship is amazing and full of fun. However there has been times (roughly once or twice a year) when he's particularly stressed and when an argument breaks out he has become violent. As of recent I've addressed these issues with him and told him that what's he's been doing isn't normal and that I am not to blame for his out bursts. I've told him if it happens one more time then we are done for good. He's extreamly sorry and realises that he's been a monster to me at times. Does anyone here been in a similar situation as me? And can things actually change or am I just wasting my time? Thank you all xx",TW Physical Violence
Regretting telling friends and family about the incidents,30,"I (22F) have been having small problems with my boyfriend (20M) for a while. It started out small. Him grabbing me by the arm when he got upset, making me flinch when he would get angry and throw things or hit things. Then he started to grab me by the face when he would get angry and his eyes would be so wild. I knew when I got into this relationship that he had a temper but it had never been directed at me. Mostly it came out when he was watching sports. I always knew it wasnt normal how angry he got or how he would yell things like ""I hope that ref gets cancer and dies!"" but I love him and I thought it was just a quirk I needed to get used to. I never had any intention of changing him but I always though that he would grow out of it as he got older. 

This last weekend he really scared me. He scared me enough I had locked myself in my bathroom because I was afraid of him. He always gets so sad after he scares me or grabs me. He will call himself stupid or a monster. He will cry and tell me how sorry he is. I went to my moms the next day and have been there since. The apartment is mine so he packed and moved out this weekend because he is going to try to get help. 

We are not together right now but I feel like that is because its what everyone else expects of me. I am sturggling with regret and telling my friends and family. Everyone keeps saying dont go back, he wont change, abusers dont change. But he is getting help, hes going to start therapy next week. I just want to believe he will treat me better and that he will change for the best. He says he will but now family and friends know about what has happened and do not want me to go back or want me to get more hurt.

Next Wednesday is hearing,2,"I'll have to come as a witness. I didn't have access to proper psychological help. I'm still blaming myself for staying with abuser for 12 years. He was rude at the beginning, he started slapping me about 8-9 years ago, and beating me really often about four years ago. I deal hard with question ""Why did you stay?"" I can't explain it to me either. I didn't want to leave. I wanted to get things back to what they were used to during good times. I'm afraid they'll see this as a lame excuse for actually enjoying such sado mazo relationship where I manipulated him to stuck with me through habit. I fear they'll see him as a victim of mine, cos I wasn't a piece of cake in terms of verbal fight. I would criticize him frequently which was the trigger for his violence for the most of times. How do I stop seeing myself as an abuser and him as simply beast in a corner? I feel like as if I was brainwashed. Do they understand what's like to stuck as a victim?

GF hit me for the 3rd and final time recently. Trying to figure out what to do. Please help.,11,"GF and I have been together for almost 2 years. Since month 2 she has threatened me with degrading words, as well as threats of infidelity because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the only thing that makes you do something‚Äù.

Not only has she been threatening infidelity, but she has thrown a few of my things, threw a painting and broke a window, and has hit me 3 times.

(now ex) boyfriend is in jail. I'm heartbroken.,24,"My boyfriend choked me twice while I was driving Saturday night. I told him that I needed gas, drove to the nearest gas station, and asked them to call 911. Because we lived together, the police said that they had to arrest him, which is fine. But I'm still so heartbroken. I can't help but think about how scared he probably is. I know that he's an adult and must deal with the consequences of his actions, but my love for him is still there and therefore I don't want him to suffer.

I'm not going back. I can't risk my life. But it's still so hard. I miss him. Just a few days ago we were kissing and hugging and saying I love you. Now he's in jail, and I'm heartbroken and alone. I feel like I'm being ripped into pieces. My heart aches tremendously.

I can hardly sleep. I can hardly eat; the thought of food makes me nauseous. I don't have the energy or motivation to take a shower. I cry about literally everything (seriously, I dropped my apple and cried for 5-10 minutes). I'm in law school, and I can't focus enough to do my school work. I can't handle this.

But she refused to leave him no matter what and with her being so depressed and sad she puts it all on me .

What Can I (F19) Do For My Dad (46M)?,6,"Yesterday was a huge mess, being Valentine's and all. My mom (38) is really abusive towards my dad. 

I started noticing it as a young kid. My dad used to be kind of shitty, he was an alcoholic/financially a wreck/recklessly driving but the bills were paid. He just spent more time at bars than at home.

My dad got into a car accident when I was 9, he wasn't driving but walking. He got hit by a van, and his skull got fractured in 16 places I think. He should not have lived. After the accident he was different. He's a recovering alcoholic, he's been sober for a couple of years and won't even eat pizza if it has a lot of yeast. He told me that my mother hit him with our van, and didn't take him to the hospital immediately.

After that accident, my mother accused him of cheating on her. My dad claimed that he didn't, but he didn't remember much before his accident. He doesn't remember a lot from before, he remembers his childhood but he doesn't entirely remember my milestones or things my mom had done to me. After she accused him, he completely deleted facebook/whatever. That wasn't enough, because later on she made him get rid of his phone. And this year, she made him quit his job. She threatened to kick him out if he didn't quit, and he isn't allowed to have any private discussions with me.

Over the years, she's completely isolated him. My dad doesn't get to speak to friends, go into stores, isn't allowed to work, or He'll get called a cheater. My dad isn't allowed to even acknowledge my sister and I as girls.

My dad married her even though she acted like this maybe 6 years ago, and for awhile she was okay. Overnight, she went from the honeymoon period to acting even worse. She regularly punches my dad in the glasses trying to break them, and he's bent them back into place many times now. Several times a week I see new marks on my dad's face, and I can't take it. I've been trying to get a place, so that my sister and I can get away from that narcissist of a woman.

She slammed his hand in the door when he talked about getting a job, she punched him in the nose causing a lot of marks, cracked one of his teeth, etc.

Even worse? She said that if he does something she doesn't like, she'll go down to the police and report him for marital r*pe.

She's over in my kitchen talking about how she puts so much into this relationship, and she's mad my dad can't stay perfectly calm when SHES ON A DATING APP.

I've seen her on match.com when I was 13, and told my father.

Yesterday she tells my father ""I'm going to go out on a last minute date with a real man who will do something for me on Valentine's""

SHE WONT LET HIM WORK, HE DOESN'T GET ANY POCKET MONEY FROM HER EITHER.

Can I please get some resources for men who are experiencing physical violence/financial abuse? My dad doesn't want to go to the police because my mom will accuse him of anything even if he didn't actually do it.

I live in the US in NJ.

He finally got arrested,16,"Last night things finally came to a head.  My husband, when he wants to argue will take away my cell phone or any lines of communication I have (he will go so far as to disconnect our landline).

My best friend (25M) put me (21M) in a chokehold and told me he ‚Äòowns me‚Äô. Is this abuse? Or am I actually overreacting?,9,"TL;DR: I am beginning to form Stockholm syndrome towards a possibly abusive friend and I‚Äôm not sure what step to take first. 

My best friend (25M) and I (21M) have been friends/roommates for over 1.5 years now. However, I have begun to notice concerning behavior that has escalated quickly. He suffers from bipolar disorder, and will go through 6 months of depression followed by 6 months of manic behavior. He is currently manic. 

For the first few months of our friendship, everything was great! However, a few months ago, I noticed he would begin to say belittling jokes towards me. This usually didn‚Äôt bother me, until I noticed he would make these jokes too often. After bringing this to his attention, he claimed to know more about me than I know about myself, and that I was displacing my insecurities onto him. I believed him, and apologized for what I had said. 

The other night, he told me he ‚Äúowned me‚Äù and put me in a chokehold while biting his lip. He then whispered ‚Äúyou know you like it‚Äù. After he let go I asked him to please never do that again. He is very muscular and I am very thin, so trust me when I say it hurt. We will sometimes rough house, but never to this extent. His dominant behavior is becoming commonplace, and I‚Äôm beginning to feel mentally unhealthy. Last night while watching tv, he pinched my inner thigh and told me ‚Äònot to struggle‚Äô. When I attempted to move my leg, he pinched harder. 

I immediately called him out, only to have him tell me to ‚Äòstop being a b*tch‚Äô and that I needed to fix my attitude fast. I‚Äôm still in shock. Im starting to think I‚Äôm in a horribly toxic situation, but I can‚Äôt seem to escape it. The next day after arguments like this, he always becomes extremely nice and apologetic, which makes me feel like he actually didn‚Äôt mean harm. But it happens again. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and I‚Äôm honestly beginning to uncontrollably feel intense Stockholm syndrome towards him. I feel trapped and I‚Äôm not sure what first step to make.",TW Physical Violence

Co-parenting with soon to be ex-husband who physically assaulted me,3,"I‚Äôve decided the best thing to do is file for divorce.  After lots of ups and downs my soon to be ex husband seems to have finally come to terms with my decision and is even cooperative about going to mediation.  

He was physically violent only a few times over the course of our marriage (not a regular occurrence and no major Injuries that could be documented) and only to me (not our kids) so I‚Äôm not sure how the custody will go but my question is more related to how to co-parent during process of divorce until custody is determined by judge.  

He is being respectful of my wanting the kids to stay with me but still wants to see them (and honestly I support this because my kids miss him terribly and he‚Äôs been good with them consistently).  I have been meeting him at public places (parks, restaurants, etc) so he can have time with them.  For the most part he keeps his focus on them but still throws in compliments or pleas for me to consider us not divorcing which I do not appreciate.  If it was up to me, I‚Äôd have gone no contact for sure because I love him and do not want to be swayed from my decision but with kids it‚Äôs hard.

I want a second chance with my husband however things are not going as planned,15,"Hi y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs 2am and my mind is boggling me and I have no one to talk to at this moment. If anyone reads this I am eternally grateful to you. Me (25/F) and my husband (28/M) have two kids together; a 18mon old and a 4mon old, a new house and new dog all within the last 3 years. We have been together for 7 years. Recently we‚Äôve been having many arguments and fights due to stress and us having a lack of support. My family lives in AZ and his in TX. Yes his family is in TX and we still had no support. Bottom line we were both exhausted of having a toddler and newborn all at the same time as COVID-19 has happened. 

Bottom line the last argument we had lead up to him choking me and in his perspective as he quoted to me ‚Äúwas the only way to get me to stop‚Äù. Yes I did start the argument and it was continuing on for at least 3 hours. We were both calling each other names back and forth and so on. However, after he did that I was terrified of him and our daughter witnessed it. I called the cops and he was soon transferred to jail for 3 days. After that we didn‚Äôt talk however we did reconcile with each other for the sake of the kids and for the love we still had for each other. He is going to counseling and admits his wrongdoings and apologized and I forgave him. He admitted that this was his fault. This was the first time he has ever done this. 

Things were going good until now; we hit rock bottom. 
I want to stay in AZ for numerous amount of reasons. For the comfort of being back with my family again, for the support they can offer and overall for my well-being and the kids. It can be a great new start as we both were mentally tired. However he wants me to move back. I have no family there. I am scared of him still and there is no guarantee of support. I currently am a SAHM and trying to get my masters degree while he is the provider. We got into it and he stated that we could switch roles if he were to move down to AZ. It would be impossible for me to make the money he is currently making right now and especially of my credentials as I have been a SAHM/housewife for the past 3 years. Now remember, this is HIS fault as he mentioned to me countless times however he wants me to fix it. He wants me to get a job and afford an apartment and provide a home for to move down. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want to sign anything that ties him to AZ because if the relationship fails he can go back to TX. Now, he already has a job, can easily sell the house and do a yard sale. But he wants me to put the kids in daycare because my gma cannot take care of them 6-8 hrs a day because of her back and age. Yes there is daycare however, I am terrified of putting them in daycare. They cannot communicate with me of what‚Äôs going on and could be abused easily by someone and there is a risk of exposing them to Covid-19 due to being around more kids and babies. Now, why should I provide that comfort when he was the one who put us in this situation at first? Yes, I can take some blame to it however I wasn‚Äôt the one in handcuffs as I didn‚Äôt put my hands on him. He also quoted to me ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have attacked you if there was no reason‚Äù He even said I‚Äôm using the kids against him but he is free to see them and come down and live with us. So please tell me. Is it worth it or should I let him go. 

Thanks for listening to my rant/story. 

TL;DR : me and my husband have been getting into arguments recently however this last argument resulted in him physically hurting me infront of our kids and I called the cops on him and it resulted him going to jail. I have connected back with him because I want to be with him still and have a family because of our kids and our recent marriage. I want to stay in AZ with my parents however he wants to stay in TX because he doesn‚Äôt want to start his life over. The only way for him to move to TX is for me getting a job and getting an apartment for us to live in because he doesn‚Äôt want to sign papers because if our relationship fails he can up and leave.

I think Corona has turned my husband into a psychopath,25,"Crossposting from relationships. Before corona, my husband (35) and I (32F) were together for 4 wonderful years. Our relationship was never an issue & we barely ever fought. We married, had a child & things were great...then corona hit. My husband has barely let me leave the house in a year. I am not allowed to get my hair cut, I'm not supposed to go shopping outside the home or see any friends and family. I was also not allowed to get a nanny or any type of child care or babysitter at all and so after trying to work and baby at the same time and almost losing my mind,  I had to cut my hours down to part-time. The funny thing is, my husband runs a office out of WAL-MART - so yes, he works outside the home. At a Wal-Mart. Anyway, my resentment has been building and building day after day of being alone stuck in the house with my child during winter. So I FINALLY was able to talk my husband into being cool with me going to see my 2 gf's whom I hadn't seen in 6 months. I had to promise to stay 12 ft apart, wear 2 masks and not eat or go to the bathroom in their house. But I got to go visit by myself, he stayed with the baby! But then, right as I was heading home from my visit, my husband saw a Snapchat of my 2 gf's from the night before at a restaurant. So because they were at a restaurant and I had seen my 2 gf's, I was exposed. So he locked me out of my house when it was -5 degrees outside. I head back to my gf's but then decide, thats my house I will get in if it's the last thing I do, I want to be by my child. When I finally was able to get into my house, he dragged me thru the living room spraying lysol all over me and then locked me in my basement for 30 mins, with me banging on the door to let me out. Today, he's letting me near my child but keeps spraying Lysol in my face and even tho I made it out of my basement, he won't let me sleep upstairs.I am now considering divorce. I love him but his health anxiety is utterly ridiculous and he is turning abusive towards me. I have suggested therapy for him and asking for marriage counseling for 6 months and he will do neither. Should I be considering divorce or am I just making a big deal out of nothing? I'm all for social distancing and masks but I can't live like this!

Still in love with him (my abusive estranged husband),7,"We got married in 2020 after 3 months of dating (now, I can recognize some of the red flags, in hindsight) he ""love-bombed"" me for straight up 7 months. I thought I was the luckiest girl in the world, but when we started having financial issues along with other ones, he started being malevolent to me. Emotional, verbal, and physical abuse took place. My friends called the cops on him and he went to jail for one night. After he came out, he went broke, financially to hire lawyers, etc. There were orders of protection in place and other no-contact orders from the military (he works in the military) so we couldn't have a clear conversation and every time we tried some sort of third-party communication thing, everything went left. Now, he's vindictive, he deleted all of my pictures from his social media, hates my guts, is back with his ex, and had some other woman harrass me online. 

I, on the other hand, can't seem to move on.  I spent most of my time romanticizing our broken marriage, thinking that we're still lovers (I know), hating myself for wanting him back, hating him for ruining everything, being scared that he's going to harm me as soon as the order of protection is lifted. Despite all of that, I filed for divorce because he wasn't doing anything; he was just keeping me in a limbo. 

Why do I still have feelings for him? Why do I want him back? Why can't I just move on? Why do I blame myself for my marriage falling apart?",TW Physical Violence

It was around Christmas time and we had lights up in our room around the windows so I could see his face and this look in his eyes that was terrifying. He was screaming at me while pushing down and gripping tighter around my neck. I honestly have no idea what he was saying, something that still bothers me about that night, because he sounded muffled and I think I was losing consciousness. All of the sudden he got off of me, laid back down, and went to sleep. I was completely frozen and afraid to try to leave. I even started to question if it actually happened. My throat was sore for days after and my voice was pretty hoarse.

I ended up marrying him the following year, had a daughter with him in 2016, and eventually was brave enough to leave with her in 2017.

Not knowing if his behaviour was domestic violence,4,"Hi, 
I just found this subreddit, and I kind of want to clear my head a little bit? Idk.
Last week I watched a video concerned with domestic abuse, what it is how it starts etc.
This was a little bit eye opening for me, because I always knew the relationship with my ex was toxic, but know I wonder if it was abusive too. 
So I wanted to ask here, whether his behaviour would be considered abusive.

The very first sign was, that he would tell me how to dress, that he didn't like my hairstyle, I should change it... So the next time he didn't like the way I did my hair, he again told me to change it but I refused and he then grabbed my bun and pulled it.

Another thing he did was that he punched things near me when I angered him, and one time during sex he even slapped me. I then told him I didn't like that, and it was the last time he did that. So does that even count as being hit?

Lastly, he would pressure me in to sex, by doing the silent treatment or getting angry when I said no. So I just started to just accept the sex, where he often choked me. I never said anything against it, so I kind of feel this one is on me?

I am still trying to understand what happened or not happened in this relationship so this is kind of an attempt to see other people's opinions and compare it to what I feel. Thank you in advance for any help with that.",TW Physical Violence

"He's not abusive, right?",5,"Ok, so first of all my husband is extremely abusive when drinking. Like he has caused so many injuries when he's drunk. However, when he's sober, he's amazing. The last time he hit me, I called the police and he signed what I wanted in a restraining order. He can call, text and video chat, but nothing in person. 

Here comes my question. I have extreme PTSD where I don't leave the house unless I absolutely have to. I met with someone a few days ago whom said my husband is advising me and controlling me and I need to stop all communication with him. My husband puts his paper in our bank account and I them transfer it all into my personal account. When he needs money he lets me know and I transfer what he needs into our account.

The abuse is getting worse,8,"TW for emotional/verbal and physical abuse

I posted a while ago asking for help because my uncle, 62, is an alcoholic who's been emotionally abusing me, F34, for months. Lately it's starting to get worse where I'm getting hit in the arm. Last month was due to him demanding I server them up leftovers and standing over me, demanding that I do it his way then verbally abusing me for not meeting his standards. Then he hit my arm when I tried to heat up my food.

Tonight we were supposed to have chicken from the crockpot but he turned it off too early so he blamed it on me, saying that I'm too lazy to tend to it even though my aunt told him that he's supposed to tend to it. When he barged into my room yelling at me for it, I said ""What did I do?"" then my aunt came in, hit my arm and demanded that I get my stuff and leave in the middle of the night for 'talking back', meaning that I tried to defend myself instead of let them have at me. I begged her to not kick me out because I didn't do anything wrong so she finally let me stay and said that it's all my fault for saying anything. There's damage on the door due to my uncle slamming it.

I'm still unable to call the cops on them because my safety and housing is gone if I attempt to do so. My other family nearby still won't help me and see me as the black sheep, blaming me for my troubles. I still don't have transportation to get out, still can't find a cheap, safe, clean place to move to and I still can't afford anything. My SSI check got cut since last month so it's harder for me to save. I'm still not getting any help from Facebook or the domestic abuse hotline who told me that they won't help me because my abuser isn't my partner/spouse. Even Reddit hasn't been helpful last time I seeked help. I'm at a loss on what to do and I can't take it anymore. But I can't leave my cat behind and I don't want them to hurt him or dump him if I get out via drastic measures.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Missing my abuser and blaming myself.,2,"TW: He was very physicially abusive and actually tried to suffocate me recently, plus choked me multiple times. He was also verbally abusive and made me feel horrible.  He was obviously great and caring in between these abusive moments. It's only been 20 days since I told him to leave. He's been at his mum's house. I asked him to return first night, (he didn't) but never again. I've been doing better and working on myself but I'm still grieving and I miss him. Every time we breakup he will either harass me and be intimidating or he will be cold and nasty and tell people he left me and tell me that he was planning to leave before I told him to leave, etc and he always makes me regret breaking up because of what he says makes me blame myself. He has told me previously I do not need restraining order because he doesn't even want me and it's so hurtful. This is the longest seperation and he hadn't really reached out to check on me and when we did speak he said maybe get back together in a while, then said no, then said he doesn't want to be on phone to me and that he is the one who left me. He said to go date other men as well which upset me. I always feel strong when I leave him or male him leave and he takes it all away every time. I've been crying less and have been pretty busy but I'm just struggling with blaming myself today",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
"I can't tell if this is just transphobia or worse because it's family saying certain things, help?",5,"I (20M) know for pretty much the last decade that I have been abused, both physically and verbally, by my father (59 M) due to his transphobia. I have a problem, and would like others to help me get a better grip on viewing these issues. Recently this last summer due to Covid-19, I was unable to continue school on campus and was forced to either go and be houseless or go back to my parent's house (And to be honest, I was unfortunately manipulated to go back, which I only realized after everything occurred).

At some point, we got into a fight, he started saying transphobic things and then he threw a table at me, but this is the part that made me so uncomfortable. He started to demand to me that I ""show him my penis"". Word for word, he said it. He said it over and over again. He told my mom(F 48) and I that ""Women are literal baby making machines,"" and that I won't be a man without proof that I have a penis. But he kept demanding that I expose myself. I feel so uncomfortable and now I don't want to even have physical contact (not that I had any in the first place thank god) or be in the same room as his without another adult accompanying me for safety.

I don't think it can be defined as sexual harassment but at the same time, those remarks don't strike me as the regular ""You're a loser and you're nothing,"" remarks I usually get. I'm confused but still shaken from this incident. I have panic attacks and lose sleep, and have flashbacks and constant nightmares and horrible night sweats after he threw the table at me and said those things. I thankfully live far from him now but can't cut contact due to keeping tabs on my mom. Please someone give me guidance.

Edit 1: I know what has happened to me is abuse. Sorry,  I guess I wasn't super clear with my question, I mean to say specifically what my father said to was confusing. Was that specific part simply just verbal abuse or would that also categorize as sexual harassment?

Edit 2: I have mentioned in this post, I live far away from both parents, so I am physically safe.  No cops were called during the assault though since the last time this happened, cops victim blamed me and made things worse.  

TLDR: my father yelled at me to expose my genitals and I don't know how to process this.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
Narcissistic abuse. This is a part of my story,2,"I talk about: coercive control, trauma made to look like entertainment, sexual assault, pedophilia. 


I (17-18yr old at the time) was being bullied by a group of teachers as well and these teachers conditioned my peers in the classroom to look at the abuse and the teachers triggering me into reactively abusing and just being in a panic attack as entertainment. Teachers laughed at it and called it ridiculous‚Äî me being traumatized by him triggering me and going into a panic attack and disassociating. 

They also affirmed my peers to take jabs at me for sport and just make me the laughingstock and mock so I could‚Äôve literally been the real life Carrie movie. 

One teacher even tried to instigate a situation with me and another female classmate as if he wanted to vicariously beat me up through her because he even jumped at me in the company of another contemptible teacher in the hallway as if he was going to attack me himself and then laughed at my reaction and mocked me. 

A few teachers and students would try to mock attack me like bumrushing me and then laugh about it. Nobody helped me. My peers were groomed and manipulated into looking at me being traumatized and being abused as entertainment. Some of my peers who knew me asked questions, but I was so shaken up and confused by the situation I was on auto pilot and totally disassociating so I was acting a little weird. I was neurotic. They were manipulated into believing that I was a liar and a contemptible person by some of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù the year prior (11th grade) my mom was in contact with administration at school earlier that school year (12th) and the teachers/admin conditioned the classrooms to be entertained by them themselves abusing me. Some of my peers were just as sick and fucking twisted and narcissistic as these teachers they were enabler‚Äôs and narcissistic themselves. 

I did my best at handling the situation and trying to escape that box that they put me in by just making fun of the whole thing I purposely would embarrass myself sometimes to control what I was embarrassed over. I was just becoming a little narcissistic myself with moving the goalposts and just trying to keep everyone off kilter to ward off the danger that was upon me. 

I had my mother against me, I had my friends/peers against me, I had teachers against me, I had my family against me, I had a child predator who I called my boyfriend against me.

My mom was the worst because she orchestrated the whole thing and sat back to watch the chaos and act like she‚Äôs trying to lend a helping hand. I had a group of peers do this to me the year prior (11th grade) and that‚Äôs why a lot of my peers and teachers are looking at me side eyed and with my mom calling my school (12th grade) which was when this all happened that just sealed the deal and everybody was gung ho on destroying me. And when these groups of people are set out to destroy me I was reacting in ways that people looking on the outside didn‚Äôt understand (like other classmates and administrators who didn‚Äôt know about the situation), but I was acting in these dramatic and seemingly erratic ways that were a little hostile and they were conditioned by the abusers to believe that I was a problem so then these ignorant people became my enablers. I was surrounded by abusers and enablers. Some people who still call themselves a friend had statistic attachment style to me. 

My mom was teaming up with all of them‚Äî my school, family, friends this child predator who is preying on me, told me that my mom acted like she  FaceTime him accidentally then started to coquettishly flirt with him pretending not to know who he was and asking his name and telling him that he‚Äôs handsome. He didn‚Äôt tell me this until I was wanting to end things with him and he seemed to get a high off of the whole thing explaining to me that my mom called him very handsome and was so hot about for him, but that she wasn‚Äôt his type so he got off the phone eventually. When I was breaking up with him he then went on to say that he would come up there and speak with my mom amour what a bad little girl I‚Äôve been (which is what I told him my mom said to me in an argument... But when my mom said those words to me it sounded off because I didn‚Äôt know at the time, but my mom was trying to infantilize me when I was becoming actualized so when he repeated those words it was just a scary twilight zone weirdness it didn‚Äôt hurt me to the core‚Äî it disturbed me). So I had that Jerry Springer aspect to the whole equation to just seal the deal of the insanity and chaos that was around me. 

And then a guidance counselor who wanted to look like a humanitarian so exploited me to look like her token black child charity case when she could‚Äôve helped me because I told her my truth while it was all happening and she pretending to be handling the situation in my best interest every time. She wanted to exploit me to help herself by looking like this humanitarian charitable person and then give me some scraps by keeping me in that suffering state and helping me here and there. Because she had a bad name for herself there for being a racist. I don‚Äôt know if those things are true but she would discourage black children from applying to Ivy League schools one of which was my friend and he actually got into that school just like she discouraged me that year as well. She gave me trinkets of help me to get into other colleges and get a scholarship while she enabled teachers abusing me, traumatizing me, triggering me, laughing at me, etc because she also was laughing at me while exploiting me and still being friends and sharing a likeness with these other abusers that she was enabling. She was just like them and started to hangout with one right on my face to terrorize me? To openly let me know she‚Äôs a wolf..? It wasn‚Äôt until I told her that this teacher called me and her bosom buddies and would often mock her in the classroom that she had me speak at this scholarship event to tell my ‚Äútruth‚Äù.. she was saving her own ass from other accusations because she had to find a way to explain why she was spending so much time with me that year. No it wasn‚Äôt because we were bosom buddies, it was because she was grooming me for abuse. She was giving me trinkets of help here and there and I felt like I was in danger and at risk by everyone and no one in my life at the time was protecting me, but trying to harm me. I looked for help within the wrong people like my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù and the counselor. I was isolated with just them and they were enablers and abusers. So my circle of people were just flying monkeys. I had so many predators around me preying on me.

I could‚Äôve when she could‚Äôve told my truth and helped me through my situation because I told her everything that was going on but in my neurotic, lethargic and disassociated state I was easily manipulated and gaslit even more and she just took advantage of the situation instead of getting me justice and when I tried to get myself justice she tried to intimidate me in her office saying that she‚Äôs heard I‚Äôve been talking a lot and that I shouldn‚Äôt talk so much. When I didn‚Äôt become intimidated but instead played dumb she tried to get on my level of playing dumb and went on to say because the scholarship she helped me to get to speak at is where I should get my speech and tell my truth instead of telling this one teacher (who now that I look in hindsight was there to help me he wasn‚Äôt a part of the whole group of teachers and administrators who were abusing me). This counselor helped me to write the speech and it didn‚Äôt feel right for me to give. I did the speech anyway but it was purposely written for me to sound like this infantilize little girl who didn‚Äôt know much about anything and taking the blame for being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and that I was helpless and traumatized by things. This kinda neutralized their abuse on me. After giving this speech the abusers had this fake ephipany of not realizing that I was traumatized and had anxiety and they feel totally embarrassed that they didn‚Äôt realize this that they had bully me because they thought I was doing this shit just pretending it was a joke. The thing is they were the ones traumatizing me and making people believe that in my traumatized state I was trying to intimidate people and cause a distraction and they should just take jabs at me for sport make fun of me mock me ridicule me and the teacher  would either egg them on in doing it or give them approval after they did that shit to me. So now they‚Äôre epiphany after I got my scholarship and took all honors classes and got straight A‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt that I was just this delinquent that was trying to intimidate people and be a distraction but that I was actually a genius and their so embarrassed for doing all this to me although not admitting what they were doing was abuse. I tried to hold some teachers accountable, but I didn‚Äôt quite understand what they did to me and they got other students involved in their abuse of me and the students were scared shitless.. a lot of people were scared shitless when the truth came out and just guiltridden. Nobody really wanted to apologize or fess up for what they did because they all played a part in fucking me over and abusing me by either abusing me or just not standing up and helping me through the shit. When I try to hold a teacher accountable and a few students, they said ‚Äúwe were trying to help you‚Äù. (Gaslighting me further). 

Everybody was scared shitless people either felt guilt ridden or just continue to project their shit onto me and take no accountability. Because everyone was involved so you could either apologize and have some semblance of a clear conscious, but be scapegoated with me or stick to your guns and still claim that I‚Äôm the problem and still bullying me because at the end of the day even though some of my truth came out the abusers were still trying to stifle my truth and paint me out to be a mentally ill, traumatized, non-credible person kinda even more so now because the speech made me look like I was traumatized I had to speak about something traumatizing up there and my one English teacher had traumatized me with giving public speeches so the whole thing painted me in the traumatize state. No one was there to protect me in my last few days of school. So it‚Äôs either I accept their apologies and fake epiphany or they were just going to continue taking out their bullshit on me even more so now.. which they eventually did kind of I needed to get help and protection but I had none of that I didn‚Äôt know where to run for it. 


Truth is when I was at my lowest because I‚Äôve been around sick motherfuckers I had to endure other sick motherfuckers some of which I thought were there for me, but just exploited me. 

My best friend (17f), my counselor, all these people show their ugly faces of just complete disgusting mess. My best friend (17f), was also sexually disturbing she tried to coercively, in a teasing manner, manipulate me into taking my pants off in front of her 26 year old bf from motherfucking Florida while he was on webcam and dance around. She was Wiccan and he was just older and dating her at 17 so yeah.. I think it was some type of witchcraft pedophilia thing. I was unimpressed and bewildered üò≥üòïüò¨. I told her I felt uncomfortable and that I thought this all was weird that they can do what they wanna do together but I don‚Äôt really want to be a part of it and that I was putting my pants back on and that maybe she should too while I‚Äôm here at her home. 

I felt like I only had the enabler best friend who reared her head as a covert narcissist because she egged on my abuse by misconstruing my intentions regarding things and when I was abused she would look the other way. She got to make herself seem like she was just a really helpful friend who is there for me through thick and thin but she was predatory she wanted me to stay in the scapegoat role. She tampered with my foodü§¢ü§Æ, had me lie to her grandma about not liking lasagna when I loved fucking lasagna and that I would only have lettuce for dinner because I‚Äôm vegetarian and then I had to deal with her grandma fussing about me not liking her food when I was hungry as fuck. Neglected me from food at her place, but demanded I‚Äôd give her food at my place, I was like literally 85 lbs at the time and she was considered overweight. She was neglectful, she was really parasitic and I felt like being around her had me start to get some of her very same illness like stomach aches and stuff.. I spoke to her just last year for the first time and she supposedly has all these other illnesses now and it‚Äôs like she wants sympathy for it. Classic. Covert. Fucking. Narcissist.

Another girl who bullied me since middle school sexually assaulted me in 12 grade. In front of a classroom with people including two adult teachers. She pulled my face to her crotch and hump it and then try to act like she was stepping over me but pretty much straddled my head between her legs while I was sitting down. The year before she had a thing of calling me my friends pet and trying to say that I was into my friends and would do anything. My friends then openly began to sexualize me and would jokingly taunt me and try to touch me or do things with me in private to which I always rejected. I think these friends were resentful of my rejection of them on top of other things so it was easier for them to throw me under the bus and be enablers of my abuse or abuse me themselves. I felt in a lot of ways they were trying to infantilize me or get me to be like some type of subhuman or pet. I think they enjoyed that role for me in some sick way because they felt inferior to me before being the popular IT girl so when I was objected, dehumanized, and bullied out of that role they enjoyed a twisted role reversal. I was at my lowest.. I pretended to be dumber and crazier than people were referring me to be and I saw some people‚Äôs true colors. Like theirs. These perversions and stuff was really her projecting her own feelings onto me. This bitch wanted me and other friends of mine who are narcissistic wanted me in those ways too. When she assaulted me I screamed and got out of her hold on me and the teacher just laughed in my face. 

Some of these peers and teachers wanted me sexually. They sexualized a lot of things that I did and bullied me about it and I wasn‚Äôt about that life and they projected their own perversions onto me and shame me over it‚Äî make me wear that shame to eventually brainwash me to believe that I am like them.",TW Multiple Trigger Warning
My abusers enabling mother.,1,"I just need to vent. So I'm pretty sure this isn't normal for mother's. My abusive ex whom I kicked out weeks ago has a mother who always enables him. When we stayed at hers for a few days she would gossip about me with my ex and they would basically gang up on me. I was pregnant at the time and she would mock me for peeing a lot, and actually didn't even believe I was pregnant and told my ex that I'm probably not. She also yelled at me in the hallway and ex did nothing about it. She also called me a drama queen for running outside when ex threw an object at my face.  He would go and repeat anything I said about her as well and make it sound bad. But then would tell me I am trying to turn him against his family. It was so insane.  We only stayed for a few days until we got on our feet. However every breakup he would contact his mum and vent about me, and blame me for everything despite the fact he's litterely an abuser. Like he's litterely strangled me at least 6 times and he has done it to an ex gf too. His mum even knows he has a restraining order on him from other ex. He would blame me for his money issues to his mum even though I am the only responsible one with money and tried to even make him budget correctly. He was financially abusive but I was still careful and hid my money. He even filmed me when I was reacting to his abuse and sleep deprivation while pregnant and sent it to her. When I kicked him out recently he went to hers and said he isn't coming back, and was obviously nasty and abusive and blamed me. Honestly I'm the only one who has actually tried to teach him how to treat women decently and who tries to make him act like an actual adult. Now that he's gone back there he has no chance of changing or growing, not like he did before but yeah. He'll most likely get back on drugs soon as well. If his step dad who he didn't get along with didn't live there he would probably stay there forever. I know he's done me a favour by not coming back but it's still upsetting.

What do I do. I don't think he'll hurt me again (mainly because I've made it very clear that I will go to the police immediately if that ever happens again) but the scar tissue. The PTSD.
