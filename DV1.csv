TW: suicidal ideation, physical abuse, emotional abuse, rape


I was predisposed to DV. My father, my step-father, my mother and my siblings were all abusive towards me. My grandmother, my grandfather’s silence, my uncle. 

I was abused for a majority of my life. My pleas were ignored. My voice was loud, but eventually it dimmed. 

And I grew up. I got pregnant by a boy who was committed to misunderstanding me. Who “only” kicked me with a steel-toed boot once, for ashing a cigarette on the porch I was about to sweep. Who “only” cornered me and screamed at me because I wasn’t listening about how everything was my fault. Who “only” choked me for a small amount of time, but controlled himself from killing me. Who “only” drove past my house to intimidate me, and steal my mail despite the restraining order. Who “only” followed me to a store, and intimidated me after telling me how he wanted me to die. My best friend told me that it wasn’t that bad, she had it worse with her past relationship. So I swallowed it down and struggled with horrid post-partum, constant begging from within to die, and PTSD. I did it alone, because it was “my fault,” I was “overreacting” and “it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was.” 

Then I got into a new relationship. He raped me, multiple times. I kept pretending it didn’t happen, and even convinced myself it didn’t through the worst of it. He tried to break my leg, but I felt guilty for attacking him once. He cornered me, like I begged him not to do. He gaslit me until I couldn’t think straight, convinced that every bad moment in my life was my own fault. I cheated on him in the end, and I woke up. This wasn’t who I was. It was a hard slap to the face. Why was I so miserable? Wasn’t I supposed to be happy? I broke it off. When I talked to my best friend again, my abuse still was invalidated... because I was not beat to an inch of my life in the process, and it clearly wasn’t bad enough since I stayed. Two other women even questioned me, asking if I just misunderstood, and that I had done something that I regretted instead. That women often have to do things for men that we “do not want to do.” When I explained that I was held down, said no, and pleaded for it to stop, there was no reaction. Only doubt. 

And then I met a man. We took it slow, and just as slowly the healing began. I’m still not okay, but my mind is clear. I’m doing better. I had another child, and my home is filled with giggles and laughter. My oldest knows love like I never imagined. My youngest will never go through the hardship the oldest did. I no longer have to worry about having my oldest taken away if I report abuse... because there is none. I can be happy, I can state my opinion, I am now free. 

Don’t give up. Fight.

My [23M] girlfriend [26F] takes play-fighting/playing around way too far. TW Physical Violence,1,"**Shes stronger than me as I was not born male and am currently transitioning. I'm 5'7 and shes 5'10 with bigger hands too. Just to provide context.**

Let's say that you jokingly nudge my shoulder as a ""Aw ur such an idiot hahahaha"" and I respond by shoving you. Hard. When you get mad, and tell me hey that wasn't cool, I reply with: ""Well, you pushed me first I just did it right back!"" How would that make you feel?

That's what I'm dealing with right now. My girlfriend and I were laying in bed and I was recording a video and I accidentally sprayed spit when laughing and she goes UGH! You spit on me! And her reaction surprised me, and I got kind of hurt but I brushed it off and laughed and said sorry, I didnt know I was so gross jeez, and sprayed a tiny bit intentionally to annoy her. I stuck my tongue out like a kid and laughed. She then proceeded to stare at me for a while, furious, get her entire mouth full of spit and spit on me when I was least expecting it, it covered my whole mouth, chin, and neck and pooled above my collarbone. It was literally flowing off, thats how much there was.

I got upset and told her she took it too far, and said well I deserved it because I spit on her. I tried to explain how there's levels and I didnt hack a loogie on her... So why did she have to take it to the extreme?

This isnt the first time or scenario where she takes things too far. We'll be play wrestling and I obviously am going gentle, and she decides to Hadduken me and actually hurt me. I stop everything and say OW WHAT THE HELL? And tell her that wasn't cool, and she says shit like well don't play fight if you're not ready to take it! And I tell her I'm obviously holding back because its supposed to be fun, we're not actually trying to hurt each other. She always turns it around on me and makes me feel bad and stupid for playing around with her in the first place and immediately gets defensive, doesn't apologize until I get mad and basically fight with her explaining how its not okay, and im left licking my wounds feeling shitty. She also says, after I explain my side, ""Well then just dont play fight with me anymore"" But thats not good enough for me because she still doesnt think what shes doing is wrong. She genuinely doesnt.

She also does shit like she'll smack me on the arm or something, not ridiculously hard but not super soft either, and I'll be like Hey lol dont do that and hit her back in less than/equal to the same force she used and she'll look at me like ""How dare you?"" and smack me even harder. I get mad and ask her, why the fuck did you hit me again??? And she said because I hit her, and I told her only because she hit me first and it was done back to her lightly so what the fuck. She'll shrug and say well, dont hit me then.

Im starting to hate her for these situations because it feels so one-sided and like its fine for me to get hurt etc. (I have PTSD from physical abuse earlier as well which is why i hold back so much as i hate violence) and shes never in the wrong, in fact IM the fucking one in the wrong somehow. I feel like im going insane.

Im scared because she's hit me for real like snatching my headphones off my head or whatever. So she smacked the back of my head trying to smack my headphones off, they came off anyways but I also got hit and I got super furious and winded up to punch her out of reflex, but she has such long reach that I never even got close to hitting her back and defending myself and she blocked it, then hit me AGAIN because ""How dare I try to punch her"" when I told her three times to stop yanking my headphones off, and not only did she not stop but she hit my head too.

She fucking got mad at me for defending myself. Im actually so angry right now I dont know what to do.

I also called her a bitch for smacking my headphones off my head 3 times and she smacked me in the face. 

TLDR; My girlfriend doesn't seem to know when shes gone too far, and doesnt accept it when I tell her that she has and doesn't apologize. I fear this relationship is physically abusive and I feel horrible for wanting to hurt her in these moments.",TW Physical Violence
if i consent to it is it abuse?,22,"TW physical violence, sex. 

I’m sorry to ask but I’ve been really unsure lately as to whether or not this relationship dynamic is safe or healthy. 

When I (F21) met my boyfriend (M24), we both expressed that we would be open to experimentation in the bedroom. I have only had 2 previous partners while he’s had quite a few, so I don’t really know what I’m into. 

This is relevant because I gave him permission to slap/spank me etc. (which he said he likes doing) but I thought that it was kind of a bedroom thing I guess? 

About a month in he just started hitting me out of nowhere. Or punching my legs or arms, but never really hard enough to leave a mark although when it caught me off guard I would sometimes fall over. I don’t know, I laughed because this clearly wasn’t out of anger or anything; we weren’t fighting, he was just playing. 

Then he started pinching me so hard I’d scream and slapping me lightly in front of his friends and they would all laugh and say “Stop!” but it seemed more like a joke. I don’t know how to explain this but it was kind of a joke that he was abusing me I guess? Because he wasn’t really. 

And then recently we were sort of jokingly playfighting then he hit me in the shoulder. Like, closed fist, full bodied force, and I immediately curled up, but still laughed because this was our joke, you know? He hit me again and I asked him to stop and then again a few more times. It was strange because I didn’t feel scared, but I started crying. Not because it hurt I think it was just shock and he looked so scared and he started crying too and held me for hours. He said he thought we were playing around and he didn’t mean to. 

To be fair, I do sometimes hit back, which is where I feel like I’m still consenting to it. You know, he’ll smack me and I’ll immediately smack back, lighter though. And I’ll laugh, which I guess is misleading. I don’t like it but I guess I don’t really mind it? 

I had to walk around for weeks with that bruise on my shoulder, and promised my 3 different people he wasn’t abusing me because I kind of don’t think he is. I think he’d stop if I asked. 

I’m sorry, I hope I’m not wasting anyone’s time. I know I’m rambling so I’m sorry if it’s kind of unreadable. I just feel like i’ve somewhat asked for it, and drawing the boundary now would be strange.",TW Physical Violence
Were my parents being abusive toward each other? (TW: Probably Violence?),3,"TW: Physical and Emotional Violence? (Unsure if it counts, but just in case)

First of all, I wanted to make clear that English is not my first language, so sorry if there's any grammar mistake.

Now, some information: I'm 17 y/o and my parents are already divorced years from now (Not legally because other issues, but they're no longer in a relationship) and since a couple of days I've been questioning my self if their relationship was abusive. My memories are kinda blurry but after years from the events something doesn't feel right.

My parents were the type that fights a lot. My memories are plagged with their discussions and for me was (and still is) the principal characteristic of their relationship. At the beginning I thought it was normal, like ""every couple fights"" but now I think there were things that can be considered abuse:

1.- My dad blamed everything on my mom. All his failures, his reactions, his behavior, everything was my mom's fault. Never took responsibility of his actions.

If he was like he was it was because some mistake my mom did (E: He blamed on her that he had to work long hours because she didn't had a job and was a housewife, we'll get into that later)


2.- He called her names. In almost every fight I remember him calling my mom ""a little sick"", crazy, and basically downplaying her with that.


3.- They hurted each other physically a couple of times. My mom kicked my dad once, and he grabbed her by the arm to the point of leaving bruises like twice (That I know)


4.- My dad threatened to call the police. My dad, after the kick, called the police (as he warned a couple of times) and we were all night at police station. For some reason finally nothing happened and we went back home. 

After that, my dad used that threat and that it wouldn't be ""that easy next time"" with the police in arguments. 


5.- He always minimized her bc she didn't finish her career. I was born in their university years, and even though my mom made it until her last year, she didn't finish. My dad almost every fight remind her that, used the ""I'm the breadwinner"" card just because she didn't had a job, and basically said that was the cause of all their problems.

My mom after some years wanted to retake her career or find a job, but my dad wasn't very helpful and didn't really supported her, so she ended up confined to the housework and childcare.

Even if that wasn't his intention, that affected my mom social life and she didn't really have many friends (plus, we were living in a city almost 3 hours away of their hometown, so no direct family/best friends for her).


6.- My mom also insulted him, but I don't remember any particular insult o name that was repetitive more than he wasn't really collaborative or he was selfish.

Finally, some facts that may be useful 

-When my mom fist told my dad he was pregnant he accused her of cheating and even called her a slut (But she justified him with ""He was young and scared)

-My dad's childhood was kinda messy (Parents also divorced)

-My dad prioritized his job and kinda himself over us. When I was little broke a lot of promises of visiting me (we didn't live together) and even under the same roof ignored us/left us aside bc he was focusing in his thesis and other projects.

-He left my mom on the middle of her retaking university (And little later he had already a new partner)


And I guess that is, or at least what I remember. Sorry if it's too long but I wanted to make things clear and I really need to know the real weight of the situation for my and my mom's inner peace (Also, I think she isn't really over it and I need more basis to her going back to therapy).

Male Victim of Domestic Violence - Never Thought I'd Be Experiencing This and IDK How to Process What Happened,12,"**Backstory**: I (25M) started dating a girl (23F), and she moved to a different state. I thought we had a future together and I moved too, leaving my friends and family. We signed a lease together, but in the end, we didn't end up working out. Together for about 1.5 years. Looking back, we had an unhealthy relationship, and I would even go to call it an emotionally abusive relationship at times from my perspective. Anyways, we decided to be friends and civil since we lived together, which was nice for a while honestly. It felt normal.

One night she had a bunch of pent up anger towards me. She was upset about our breakup, and how it seemed like I moved on so quickly with no pain, while she was heartbroken. This is accurate to say, I did move on fairly quickly by going on some casual dates. However, she was currently on anti-depressants and some alcohol was consumed by her that night.

**Physical Violence:** She was playing with our dog, threw a toy and it hit her AirPods and they went flying somewhere. I could already feel tension, and did not help her find it. She snapped at me - ""a real friend would help me look for them"". Proceeded to throw punches at my face/head, kick me when I would try to hold her arms down, and threw the AirPods case/other objects at my head. Physically, I was okay. Ended up with a few bruises and some scratch marks on my neck. I knew I could not retaliate as I would be the one being charged with assault, so I just had to stand there and take it. 

**TW: Abuser Threatening Suicide**. She called her therapist immediately after, cried, and for some reason I agreed to talk to her therapist with her. At some point she told her therapist she was a 6/10 on ending her life. Immediately I forgave her, and hugged her. What happened to me was less important in that moment, I would never want anyone to harm themselves.

**Coping:** For weeks, I personally had no anger towards the situation. We still hung out with our mutual friends like nothing happened. I was okay with it. Fast-forward a month or two to this week and feelings of anger and resentment are popping into my head.

I am angry at myself for ignoring what really happened and sort of sweeping it under the rug like it's no big deal. I felt like since my injuries were not that severe, maybe it doesn't count towards domestic violence. Now, I'm realizing violence is violence. She is an abuser. Especially as a male, this doesn't get talked about much. I want to change that.

**My Thoughts Now :** Should I be mad at myself for my initial reaction? I'm mad at myself for hugging her, I'm disgusted that I thought it was no big deal. I told a couple of our mutual friends about what happened shortly after the incident, and it seems like ""life goes on,  I'll still be friends with her” is their mentality. It pisses me off how it seems like there are no consequences for what she did. I wish I filed a police report or did something legally. But I didn't. I think I want to share my story with all of our mutual friends and maybe go public on social media with it eventually? Am I dealing with this the right way? I'n not even sure. I just know I want there to be consequences for what she did.",TW Physical Violence
"After a year, I finally gathered the courage to leave",12,"TW: Mention of physical and verbal violence.

Just needed a place to vent.

I've been living with my ex for a year now. He started off nice enough, but there were red flags that I just didn't notice. As soon as we started dating, he made me move in with him and get rid of my old apartment. I had just moved into this small town 4000km away from my family and didn't know anyone, and thought it would be a good way to save money on rent.

He let me adopt a cat. He bought me nice things. But then he started getting drunk all the time and being belligerent. Telling me I was evil and an emotional vampire. That I was a baby for crying all the time. That I was weak. He started hitting my cat and throwing him around when he was meowing.

Then he hit me, and promised he'd stop drinking. He did, but started again about a month after. The second time he hit me he told me he was done drinking for good. But then it wasn't the drinking anymore, it was that he was too tired of me talking, or walking too loud, or ""complaining about everything"". He started throwing things at me, a speaker, books, anything really.

I wasn't myself anymore. I was the most outgoing, extroverted person you could ever meet, and now I barely speak or make a noise. The only thing I had left to let out my stress was my guitar, and I started playing it a lot because I didn't have friends or anyone apart from him to talk to, but then he cut my strings because it was annoying him.

I'm moving back home. I spoke to my dad, and he's letting me move back with him, even with the cat (he's super allergic to them.) I'm leaving in March. It can't come soon enough. I'll be able to go back to university and see my friends again and be myself.

I'm finally ready to heal. I want to be myself again. I'm so hurt and scared, for some dumb reasons I'm scared to leave him because I love him. For Christmas he bought me so many gifts. I feel guilty for leaving becayse of that. But I'm done.",TW Physical Violence
What's wrong with me? (Long),4,"If anyone reads this, I'm grateful. I've never expressed this to anyone, ever.

**Tw: physical and emotional abuse, substance abuse, violence**

I'll try to keep it brief. I'll also be vague in some respects, as my spouse has reddit. This is an alt account. 

My spouse has many amazing qualities and I love them so so much. We have been married over a decade. But this doesn't change the fact that they are a drug addict, even after rehab last year. It doesn't change the fact that they're controlling. They check my phone. We're both taking online courses but we don't have work outside of the house right now, so I can't make calls and texts in private. This included medical appointments, which has been used against me in arguments. And no, it doesn't change the fact that I've been physically abused numerous times by this person I love so much.

I've read that we should look at our situation as if it were a friend in the situation. I'd happily destroy anyone who beat up my friend. I mean... they beat my ass like it's a bar fight. I've been choked until my vision went fuzzy. I've been literally thrown around our house. All of this has happened multiple times, much more severe since quarantine started and he relapsed. I would literally murder anyone who did half of this to my friend, so why can't I stand up for myself?

My spouse succeeded in isolating me from everyone but them. We moved to their country and I know nobody here. Both of our families are abusive so I literally have nobody within 900 miles of me besides my spouse. My spouse has friends and ""their"" people here, but I haven't made any connections with anyone here.

I have two close friends who became a family to me. They're also from broken/abusive homes and we've been like sisters since high school, decades ago. They've been through a lot this year too (like too many of us) but I know exactly what they'd say... They'd say to come to them. Stay in their homes, play with their children, be safe and looked after, just for awhile. We've been there for each other this way before and I know that unlike many, I have a safe place to go. 

But I don't go. I can't go. I know I'm sick in the head. I wish I had the courage but I really, really love my spouse. They've also been by my side and supportive through difficult times. I know they're still in there. They show great sadness and regret which makes me sad too. We're both just so sad and broken but I don't know why they hurt me and I don't know why I don't leave, even just for awhile, for both our sakes? I could send a few texts and my friends and I would buy a plane ticket and go stay with them. It could have been done in the time it took me to write this. 

But I didn't. I don't know if I ever will. And that's the real problem. I have no answer except that I love my spouse very much, and it's clearly apparent that I don't care about my personal safety at all. 

It's sad. I could have done a lot.

How can i persuade my best friend to get out her abusive relationship & move in with me,4,"Your advice would mean so much to me. Tw this does include sexual violence & mental health crisis.

Having had lived in a dv situation, i know what its like & i know that its not as simple or easy to juat persuade someone to leave but sometimes we really have to give it a shot.
My best friend (f20) has been with her abusive partner (m19) for three years. Her (m) & i became friends two years ago but unfortunately i live interstate so we have only got to hang out three times & soon m will probably be coming up to stay with me.
Ms boyfriend (c) absuers m in every way by controlling her, manipulation(gaslighting/guilt tripping), belittling her, isolating her (i am her only friend), physical abuse (which ive keeped evidence of on my phone), betraying her to be the bad, lying, cheating, attention seeker one & r*pe + he cheats.He doesn't like the fact that she seems happier when with me so he “doesn't let“her stay with me very long or when i go visit her, we arent easily left alone. 

Cs abuse is something i believe shes become conditioned to. Where she is, Melbourne Australia, she has no family or friends & i am literally the only close outside person she has so she has never had much else support or healthy love & now has no where to go. She wouldn't be comfortable going to a shelter of any sorts as she has before & it was a horrible experience. She knows what hes doing is vile & not how a partner should be but i think regardless she still loves him & is afraid to make that step in moving in with me where she is supported by my friends & family as well as we all empathise & i know they although not close to her, appreciate her presence. I am so, so afraid for her safety some days because cs family does the minimum to protect her & he is very violent. There's really not much i can do other than be here for her & let her know she has a safe space but i can't stand it anymore. I hate to think that my best friend may become even more conditioned to this when she ia deserving of so much better. 

So please, what are some ways i can persuade her further? She is in uni atm so she would have to sort all of that out first so i dont think she can not return from this visit but i will still be talking to her. I just want to know what others have to say, have you had a friend do this for you? What helped you feel secure in leaving that dv situation & staying with them? What are some things people have said that really helped you have the courage you needed? I know i need to be patient, compassionate & remind her i love her & that she deserves better but i still want to know as much i can that will help me do this. 

TL;DR
my best friend is being abused in every way by her bf of three years & has now become conditioned to it. I am her only outside connection & live in another state to her but its been very hard to convince her to move in with me. I am very scared for her safety as she refuses to go to shelter & his family doesn't do much to help her. I know i need to be patient & compassionate with her but what are some other stratigies i can use? ❤️

*Some history:*
---
our family is small; just 4 of us: me, my sister, my mom, and an uncle we never see other than holidays. My sister and I are extremely close despite that I live in another state for the last 5 years, we have always texted all day and talk 3-4 times a week. 

My sister met her girlfriend 2.5 years ago in a bar after being broken up with by her longtime non-abusive girlfriend (9'ish years together). She was heartbroken, increased to weekly therapy, dated a bit and was doing really well after about 6 months, she met this girl about a year after the breakup.


---
---
*The relationship and abuse:*
---

long story short, issues my sister brings up most often is the girl gets drunk every night and is an angry/quiet drunk, she texts all the time and hides her phone, and has really intense mood swings that last a few days up, few days down. 


They broke up and got back together 4 times for a myriad of reasons: the girl cheating repeatedly, the girl trying to ultimatum me and my mom out of my sister's life ""it's me or them, you obviously don't have a good history with them""; for screaming fights where the cops are called; for the girl admitting she’s married “just for the benefits” but still sleeps with the wife, for the girl hiding booze in my sister's drinks to make her stay over when my sister didn’t want to, for the girl trying to force my sister to get rid of her dog. My sister breaks up with her a 4th time and are apart for 6 months.


Covid hits, my sister gets depressed, they begin to text again, eventually, they are back together. Throughout all this, I was talking my sister through how the textbook extremely abusive behavior from the girl. My sister has repeatedly written it off as “not the (the gf's) fault, it’s her mental illness and childhood trauma”. 


---
---
*The suicide attempt:*
---

That brings us to 1 month ago and where my issues with it all come in. My fiancé and I have been together 13 years and we pushed our huge wedding back a full year due to covid so we aren’t getting married until October 2021. A month ago we decided fuck it, let’s elope to Vegas; we invite our 3 bffs & my sister. 


After a long talk and that I didn’t think the girlfriend should come, my sister promises “things are great we are perfect now” sure, whatever. Weekend comes, we all arrive, I meet the girlfriend for the first time - she seems shy. I start chatting with her, do a shot with her, make small talk, try to make her feel welcome and part of the group. The girl sits on her own and still seems in her shell, my sister is trying to encourage her to hang out but the chick isn’t into it and just is on her phone. 


We all get dressed up, find a random wedding chapel; me & my fiancé get married, yay fun, then as we are waiting for 2 ubers to take us back to the strip, the group conversation turns to “who would get married in Vegas next”. My sister says to the gf “I’d marry you in Vegas! I love you 😊”, the girlfriend responds “Ha. Right. I wouldn’t fucking marry you. Why would I, you keep leaving me.” 


The ubers pull up right then. We separate them between the ubers, my sister comes with me, she’s sobbing. My friend texts me from the other car, the girlfriend apparently was scream-crying, he and his husband try to calm her down to no avail. When their car parks, the girlfriend takes off running to Excalibur (our hotel) no one follows. 


The other uber, our uber, drops us off at NYNY, our friends in the other car call and ask if they should just let the girlfriend leave and my sister yells “yes fuck her I’m done, she knows this isn’t her weekend to start a fight”. 


We all go drinking elsewhere the rest of the night my sister apologizes a million times, eventually turns off her phone, we get her back to having fun, the night isn’t ruined, and we are rid of the drama girlfriend yay! 


My sister and I talk about that I’ll get her stuff from the room since she will sleep in our friends’ room instead. Once we get back to the hotel at like 4am, I go to the room for the stuff, the girlfriend wakes up, starts yelling lunges at my sister. My husband, a firefighter who knows how to deescalate due to his job, gets between them, cops and security come knocking, we get them separated and all go to bed. 


2 hours later its 6am, we are all asleep, I hear sirens and people yelling in the hall. Knocking at our door starts, it’s the same cops and security, only now flanked by paramedics, they immediately come in, ask questions, cops separate us and we are all confused – they keep asking what domestic violence happened the night before. Luckily the same cops are back, they believe us when we say we stayed in our rooms after they left earlier.


After 10 minutes of questions, they tell us that the girlfriend had slit her wrists in the bathroom, called 911 on herself, she was stable but lost a lot of blood. My now-husband is a paramedic and went out to talk to the medics more, yep she was bad off and being transported. We spent the rest of the day at the hotel, dealing with security, cops, and hotel manager. 


My sister was a mess, had a phone session with her therapist, was very adamant she was done and this was the last straw. Our friends were super supportive and we were trying to salvage the remaining day/night. As far as the girlfriend, I had high hopes and really thought this might be the actual last straw and my sister would be done. NOPE.


We went home the next day, my sister had committed to being our ride to the airport, but then backed out last minute after spending 45 minutes on the phone privately. She left early and in a rush, didn’t tell me anything. The next day we talked, she admits she went to see the girlfriend in the hospital, brought clothes, food, spent a few hours there and then got another hotel room. She drove back the next day and has completely moved in with the girl now. 


once I found that out, I asked ""where is the line?? when she attacks you? if she tries again, you try to stop and she hurts you instead? if she tries again? she's already taken your phone multiple times when I call, you don't talk to mom anymore, where is your line??"" my sister kept saying ""I don't know, her mental illness is way too big for me to answer that.""

What I need help with is how the hell do I talk to my sister about this? We had a pretty good long conversation where I really laid out my feelings the day after we got home, but its been 3 weeks and I am ANGRY and feeling so mega protective. 


I initiate every text since this happened because I am scared my sister is going to disappear, officially cut off from me cause I'm so mad, so every conversation it’s been me asking how she is and her telling me her feelings, what her therapist says, how her anxiety is so bad but she “doesn’t know why!”. I got 1 apology during the one phone call, where she also told me she was mad I didn’t let her see the bloody room.


I am her sister, but I’m not her keeper, I cant and don’t want to control her but I want to big-sister this and try to be there for her...but frankly, I’m so fucking mad. I in a way want my sister to see that she has chosen a shitty selfish person who refuses to take care of themself, and under no circumstances will I let that person into my life too. The girl has tried to force my sister to choose ""me or your family"" and i feel like this was that yet again. 


I am kicking myself constantly for a lot of my decisions surrounding the weekend, and I’m trying to process it all as it comes up. I have no idea if I should just let my sister initiate conversation if I should bring up my feelings? If I should be the one trying to keep our relationship going or let her see what life is like with this psycho as her partner? I just don’t know. I already made it clear this girl is not welcome in my life at all. She is not allowed at our big wedding next year either obviously. 


How do you talk to your sibling about their abusive relationship? How do you advocate for them when they won't for themself and when do you know to stop, and HOW do you stop?? Am I out of line for feeling like me and my husband are owed a huge apology by this girl and my sister?

my sister has been in a 2 year on-again-off-again relationship with a woman who has cheated a ton, a heavy drinker, 3 untreated mental illnesses, verbally abusive, has almost completely isolated her from her friends family and dog, and physically abused her on 2 occasions that my sister opened up about. 

My now-husband and I secretly eloped in Vegas 3 weeks ago with our 3 friends and my sister & girlfriend there, and while there this girl tried to commit suicide in the bathroom after a fight with my sister after being confronted about cheating yet again. My sister took her back, I have no idea how to talk to my sister or how to proceed.",TW Physical Violence

Medical Proxy?,4,"My mother (48F) is preparing to leave her husband (51M).

Preparing to start over after leaving my emotionally abusive relationship,5,"I am preparing to move out of my ex's house this week, we had been together for almost three years, in which he was EXTREMELY emotionally abusive. I had been done with the relationship since February, right when I started job hunting so I could find work and move out the pandemic hit and I been waiting around for things to improve before I moved out. I booked myself an air bnb for a month to give myself time and space to plan out where I am going to go from here. I want to apply for low income housing, food stamps etc but I wouldn't have an address and I don't know anyone in the area that I am moving to. I had moved to Alabama with my ex since he got a job there but I am from the west coast. I am moving up to Indiana, so I don't have any friends or family there to use their address. Is there a way I can still apply for aid?

Seeking advice,1," An important woman in my life is involved with a man who is psychologically and emotionally abusive. He's never hit her but he has followed her, constantly belittling and demeaning, accusing her of cheating, yelling/screaming and he recently bought a recording device to monitor her communications and a tracking device for her vehicle. She left for a couple of days. She said she recognized all of the unhealthy behavior and was prepared to leave him for good. He convinced her that he only bought the surveillance equipment because his therapist suggested it. She has returned to the marriage. I begged and pleaded with her to choose herself and not return to a home where she hides from him out of fear. Is there anything I can do? Or do I just have to walk away?",Preparing To Leave
Co-parenting with my abuser,5,"So....this is going to sound insane, I imagine. In some way.

I'm preparing to leave my abusive relationship. The abuse has been primarily emotional, psychological, a bit financial, just overall very controlling and unhealthy. It's only gotten physical and sexual a few times, and still ""not that bad"". I know better than to say that, but I'm sure many of you know what I mean. Anyway, I have a child from a previous relationship, and also a 6 month old baby. In leaving my boyfriend, I will have a custody and child support battle, which TERRIFIES me. Especially learning about how the laws don't automatically favor mothers, even when children are still infants. Here is my conundrum....since I know that I will likely have to co-parent with my abuser, given that even convicted felons can get supervised and sometimes unsupervised visitation with their kids, is it even worth it to try to get a restraining order and bring up the abuse in court? Since legally speaking, it definitely ""isn't that bad."" Do I owe it to my daughter to try my best to keep her father away from her? He's never done anything to her, but then again she is a lovable infant. Who knows how he might treat her in the future. He seems to so genuinely love her. Ugh. I know leaving might give me better perspective, it's just so hard knowing that I can't actually prevent him from seeing her forever.",Preparing To Leave
Is it common for dv hotlines to call police?,10,"I usually call 1800 respect and they're really helpful. Last time I called them they called the police. They've never done this before. I haven't called again yet due to this. After they contacted police I received a text telling me police are trying to locate me to check if I'm safe due to what I told the hotline. Abuser saw this. I thought the text was not a good idea.  The police never came as I didn't give them my location. I understand that they were concerned and I take it seriously however they knew I didn't want police at the house. 
I feel stupid for not calling police myself but I'm not ready to. I'm actually angry at myself each time I don't call police. But I feel like all it will do is make him angry. The housemates will take his side as they are his friends and protect him. They do not care about me. Police will see I'm not safe and won't let me stay at the house which has happened to me in a past dv situation. Either that or I won't be believed as abuser always tells me. I'm not prepared to leave my home this second or to deal with more of his anger. I'm going to leave him again soon and I want leaving to be my own choice. Thats why I called them so I could talk and feel better. It just makes me not want to call a hotline again and I feel more isolated.",Preparing To Leave
"I need to leave, but I'm scared.",9,"So...long story short....I am 23/F and I have an extremely dysfunctional family situation. My parents are divorced, and I'm back living with my abusive father after my first attempt at flying solo didn't quite work out. He invited me back when I was struggling financially, and I was so tired of struggling that I caved against my better judgement. Of course, it was a giant mistake. When I say that he is abusive, I mean that he verbally and emotionally abuses me. He has never hit me, but he's obsessed with guns and weapons and I feel that that is a very large red flag.

He has full custody of my minor siblings. They have been conditioned to believe that he is the only one who cares about them, and that their mother abandoned them. I was treated very poorly for continuing to have contact with her and her family. Even though I was 19 at the time of the divorce, I was not really allowed to have my own opinion - it was dad's way or the highway. 

To get to the point - currently, I am preparing to leave again within the next few weeks or months. I do not think it will take me longer than 2 or 3 months to get the launch money I need for deposits, first month's rent, etc. But I just feel completely shitty about it. For all my dad's talk about how I'm mooching off of him while I'm here, he never treated me any better or told me he was proud of me when I moved out. I dealt with sexual assault, tons of harassment for being a young woman on my own, financial concerns, and medical issues. It was the most demoralizing experience of my life, and he took advantage of that to lure me back here and abuse me some more. As much as I want and need to leave, I find it hard to look at the future with optimism. I'm posting here partly just to get this all off my chest, but also because I really want somebody to confirm what I already know deep down - that I'm in a dangerous place, that it will be okay if I run, that I can do it. For a few days I have been lurking here and that has helped somewhat. Thanks for listening.

How do i get out of here?,16,"He won't stop, every small thing i do sets him off and pretty soon hes grabbing my face, screaming at me, pushing me. Calling me a whore, ugly, a bitch, etc. 

It's been 2 years, ive wanted to leave him since Christmas of last year but i am honestly so afraid. 

we dont live together but he keeps pestering me to move in and i am running out of time. If i dont agree soon, he'll flip out. i have to leave before i finish school, ive got only 4 months. 

i am scared he's going to humiliate me, he's going to ruin my name, he's going to turn the world against me and make life living hell. I have to leave before i seem obligated to live with him, if i actually move in, i could only imagine what he'd do. I've made so many changes, preparing to leave him, but i still feel so alone. hes forced all my friends away. 

it would be easier if i had more support, i dont know how to leave without him getting mad, i dont know the right time, i just wish some other guy would come and tell me he'd protect me from anything that happened if i went with him, anyone who seemed like a decent person, i dream of that everyday

How do i leave without him harassing me online, posting statuses about me, trying to destroy everyone's opinion of me, lying about me , etc

i need to leave without him being too mad",Preparing To Leave
Creating a record,15,"I'm posting here for two reasons.  First, I have no where else to turn.  Like many people who post here, I can't tell anyone what's happening.  I just can't.  I'm supposed to be smart.  I have so much invested in this relationship.  We have a dog.  We have a life.  We share a car.  Our families and friends have spent thousands on our upcoming wedding.  I don't know where I'd go.  I would be humiliated, devastated, lost.  He's my best friend.

But I'm also writing it down so that it's documented somewhere.  So that if the day comes that I need to prove that he was abusive, I at least have a record, somewhere in the ether.

He gets so angry sometimes that he grabs me and drags me by my hair, kicks me, holds my head down, holds me by my neck.  When I told him today that I feel like I can't ever get angry - unless it's in JUST the right way - because there will be consequences, but that he can get angry however he wants and I just have to take it, he told me that's not true because if he was able to express his anger for real, I'd be dead.  I don't know how many times he grabbed my neck, my hair, my head today.  My head is pounding and my face feels swollen but I don't think there will be bruises this time.  He holds me down, makes it hard to breathe, tells me he'll stop when I say I'm done, when I say I understand, when I agree to shut up.  He kicks me sometimes when I'm curled up on the floor, but he has never hit me.  I think he kicked me twice this time.  Today he ripped my favorite shorts off of me - they're in pieces now.  When I protested and told him that those were my favorite, he told me ""they look bad on you anyway.  You could lose some weight.""  Last time it got really bad like this - I think it was late February - he left bruises on my arms from dragging me down the hall, and he ripped my favorite sweatshirt off of me and then proceeded to tear it into smaller pieces in front of me.  I had to wear long sleeves for two weeks that time.

Two weeks ago, I was out of town and we got in an argument over the phone.  He got so angry that he threatened to burn several of my most precious possessions, things my deceased grandparents left to me, unless I listened.  How he made me repeat after him, ""I'm a dumb bitch and I'm going to shut the fuck up now"" or he would burn the pillow my grandma made, the hat my grandpa who just died always wore, the blanket my grandma hand-knitted me.  He was angry because I didn't listen to him.  Because I reacted unproductively during an argument we'd had earlier.  Because I made him feel ignored and dismissed.  Today, he was angry because he thought I expressed my frustration poorly last night when he woke me up repeatedly by tossing and turning.  He said I was being a cunt.  From what I remember, I told him he kept waking me up and asked him to stop.   Yes, there was frustration in my voice - I had been woken up several times, and I was half asleep.  He thought it was a gross overreaction.  It feels like whenever I try to defend myself, or when I try to explain - when I do anything but agree and take all the blame, he makes me pay.

I always wind up doing what he says.  I say what he wants.  I do what he wants.  Because I don't want him to keep hurting me and I don't want him to destroy the things I cherish.  And I know him.  I love him so much.  I know this isn't him.  I know how much pain he's in, I know the demons he struggles with.  *I know he has a good heart*.  I know he doesn't want to hurt me.  He is so supportive and so loving and so wonderful, in so many ways.  He lifts me up and makes huge sacrifices for me.  And it would ruin his life, to tell anyone.  It would ruin his chances of any kind of career.  And I don't think he deserves that.  I still just find myself wanting to love him and protect him.  I know I sound like the ultimate cliche of a battered woman.  I know I'm the classic case, the epitome of pathetic, stuck in the cycle of abuse and unwilling to break it because I'm holding out hope that the man I love and chose to marry is still in there somewhere, that I can coax him back out, that I didn't make a huge, awful mistake by investing so much of myself and my life in this love.

&#x200B;

He says it's the only way to get me to calm down and listen.  That he doesn't like doing it, that he doesn't want to hurt me, but he *needs* me to calm down and listen and it's the only way he's discovered that works.  He says once I'm in ball on the floor crying, once he's broken me down enough, that's when he knows we can actually get somewhere productive.  He used to apologize, used to tell me he felt like a piece of shit, used to promise to work on it.  But then I started bringing his apologies up sometimes when he would start to get angry and physical again, just to try to get him to realize he didn't really want to hurt me, so now he doesn't apologize anymore, because he doesn't want me ""throwing it back in his face.""  Once he calms down, he usually acknowledges how he contributed to the conflict that started everything.  He almost never acknowledges his part initially, and in fact it's usually me trying to get him to take some kind of responsibility rather than just blaming me that pisses him off and starts the abuse.  

But he never apologizes for getting physical anymore.  He tells me that I should know better than to piss him off, that he warns me to stop (stop getting angry, stop trying to talk to him, stop trying to explain, etc.) and if I don't stop, then what happens is my fault, and he won't apologize for that because he's taking what he needs when I won't give it to him.  The thing is, he does warn me, at least in the beginning.  He *always* tells me that he's starting to get pissed off and that I should walk away if I know what's good for me.  Sometimes, I do, and he calms down, and we talk about it later and nothing happens.  But sometimes, I find myself going FUCK THAT.  Fuck you threatening me.  *Nothing* I do should *ever* result in physical aggression, and I should be able to say what I need to say without being thrown on the ground because you don't want me to say it at this moment, or in this way.  He says I'm being emotionally abusive by forcing him to participate in a conversation he doesn't want to have, by refusing to give him space when he asks for it.  He says I'm hurting him by forcing him to listen to me or to talk with me when he doesn't want to, or when he's not in the right headspace to, or that I'm hurting him by behaving aggressively when I *know* that any kind of aggression is only going to piss him off.  And to him, my hurting him in those ways gives him the right to take what he needs to protect himself, however he needs to.  He says he wants to work on it, he wants to not escalate, but I have to give him the space to do that by leaving him alone when he asks me to.

The pathetic thing is that I find myself buying it.  He *does* warn me.  I *do* know that if I continue to try to get him to listen when he's telling me not to, or if I get angry and yell with any kind of aggression or vitriol in my voice - that he'll respond and he'll escalate, and 9 times out of 10, it will be physical.  So in some ways, it *is* my fault, because I let my pride take over and I refuse to allow his threats to make me back down, or I yell back at him and tell him to shut the fuck up about my dad/mom/family/skin/body/emotional baggage, or I snap at him when he interrupts me because any time I interrupt him, he jumps my shit, so why should he get to interrupt?  And maybe I am being a bad partner by forcing a conversation, or by getting aggressive.  Maybe that is emotionally abusive, too.  Is it?  I honestly don't know anymore.  I just get so mad, because when I need space - when I ask him to leave me alone but he doesn't want to - he *never* leaves me alone.  And he can be as aggressive and vitriolic as he wants to be, and there's nothing I can do, because if I respond in kind, I will pay.  I have no choice but to take it, because *even* if I was willing to get physical (which I'm not, the few times I've pushed him back, I've felt beyond awful about it to the point that it's not worth it), I am about 40 pounds lighter and a whole lot weaker.  I am a woman and he is a man.  I've tried saying horrible things to him to get him to leave me alone in those moments, but he just laughs and tells me it doesn't affect him because he's not weak like me, and he can tell I don't mean it anyway.  He's right about that.  When I point the hypocrisy out to him, he says that I'm scorekeeping and it's not productive, and that he only refuses to leave me alone when I ask because ""why should he when I don't do it for him"" (which, ironically, is also scorekeeping - something I have pointed out, to which he responds that he's only keeping score because I am).

&#x200B;

I just find myself wondering if it is my fault.  If I'm the shitty one for knowing what's going to happen and pushing anyway.  I know not to push.  I know not to yell.  But I do it anyway.  He tells me not to.  He warns me what will happen.  And I still do.  

I think just don't want to be *that* pathetic.  I'm already pathetic enough.  I'm already the girl who wore long sleeves for two weeks.  I'm already the girl who makes excuses for her partner's abuse, who insists to herself that he'll change, who lies to everyone around her to make everything seem like it's okay, because maybe if it seems like it is then it will be.  I don't want to be even more pathetic, I don't want to be the girl who shuts up when she's told to shut up, just because she's trying to be heard and she's saying something he doesn't like.  

&#x200B;

Anyway.  This is a record, just in case I need to prove it.  It's okay if nobody responds, I don't think I want any responses anyway.  I can imagine what the responses would be:  Leave.  Concern for my safety.  Leave.  Prepare to leave.  

I know, logically, I know.  I just need a record somewhere, and I need to get it out, because I can't - or I guess I won't - tell anyone, and I just can't feel this alone anymore.",Preparing To Leave
"My mum is emotionally, verbally and at times physically abusive to my dad. I understand she has had some issues in the past, and it seems incredibly hard for her to move forward. What should a 17 year old living with their parents do?",9,"Hi,

the abuse can go on for 5–7+ for hours on end each day like crazy for a week, but there can be months without it. My mum has been diagnosed with PTSD but the infromation she shared with her therapist was very biased and she unfortunately exaggeratted many of her incidents (which she has exaggerated in her mind unfortunately)

Many of her problems with her past arise from a lack of assertiveness and her avoiding smaller conflicts in familial relationships in the extended family which has led to the current, longer and complicated conflicts, a result of her regrets and issues boiling under the rug for many years.

If the genders were reversed, this would most certainly be considered verbal abuse stemming from a lack of responsibility in the past. Unfortunately, these issues have led to my mum retreating from society, with little social life and little physical exercise, which in my experience are paramount to good mental health. Consequently, she has become more afraid and anxious then ever and financially dependant on my dad, without a job. I really feel for her, she is trying to fix these issues but her mental patterns seem to be a large obstruction. Her mental state is so corrupted, all she can do is yell for at times entirely 8 hours straight, just pure angry and she seems to enjoy it. I am genuinly scared that she might severly injure my father in this and have cried a couple of times…

Whenever we try to discuss a possible solution such as separation which would involve financial independence, she just goes on a rant of exaggerated events in the extended family that happened maybe twice in her life(akin to jokes your friends might make) as the sole reason as to why she has no self-confidence and no concentration to study. Though this is certainly true, her and I both know that is the solution, yet she is unwilling to put the effort in. She insists on preparing every single meals for us and cooking too much snacks for us which occupy her time immensely. I feel for her, the regret and dwelling on the past which causes inaction which causes more regret the day after. It has certainly worsened the situation. My sister and I have decided to make more meals ourselves and do more chores so she has more time to herself.

On the other hand, my dad’s genuine attempts to help her are shut down by mum, as she thinks they are “a way too make himself seem better”. My dad seems to be a trigger point of the previous conflicts she has had with the family members of my father, some of whom are now deceased. She does not want to take any assistance from him and feels guilty spending “his money”, however my dad has convinced her to pursue an education to help her become financially independent and separate if she desires to do so. The abuse, the shouting he gets in return is absolutely horrendous, she abuses him for what people related to him did to her 10 years ago at 7 in the morning and belittles him for every little thing. In this rage, she can’t think clearly and it just worsens and is unable to hold logical discussions and finds obscure tangents so she can continue her rant. She controls my dad and says doesn't want to see her face but doesn't let him leave the house either. 

I pray to God my mum becomes courageous, becomes independent and has a stable mental health. And that my father is also able to live in a safe and peaceful household.

I also have a younger sister (14), though quite mature, but i am concerned for her future mental health.

Freedom after abuse is possible.,7,"I was engaged to an abuser.  I left him a little over a year ago.  He kept calling me every day and even after I broke up with him, I didn't have the strength to refuse his calls.  Just before Thanksgiving, he stopped calling every day and has only called twice since then.  I am so thankful to be free.  

I cannot attribute leaving to myself, my willpower, only to chance and lucky circumstances.  Leaving an abuser is incredibly difficult.  I am in the military and got orders elsewhere.  We remained a couple when I moved for just over a month before I could no longer take the abuse and I broke up with him.  The only reason I was able to do it was because I was separated from him by a thousand miles.  I was lucky.  

December 23rd would have been our one year anniversary if I'd gone through with the wedding.  I am so thankful that I am free.  I am so glad I am free.  I try to respond to many people on this subreddit in hopes that they might be able to break free, but I think I was answering well before I left my own abuser.

I came to this subreddit for help because I was abused.  I think I found it a couple of months after I realized I was in a relationship with an abuser.  When I first realized it, I googled ""early warning signs of an abusive relationship"" and my abuser hit most of them.  That realization is hard to come to.  At the time, we had been together five months.  We were together another nine months after I realized it.  

For the most part, he was emotionally and psychologically abusive.  Our relationship was accurately described by the three phases: the honeymoon phase, the tension-building phase, and the explosion phase.  I always walked on eggshells in hopes that I wouldn't set him off, but his outbursts were completely unpredictable because they had nothing to do with what was going on between us.  

In the last paragraph, I say ""for the most part"" because I think he could be described as physically abusive, too, though he never hit me.  I cannot say whether he would have started hitting me someday if I stayed (probably, though there's no way to tell for sure).  I fully expect that I would end up a murder statistic if I stayed with him.  

I keep thinking of the night he pulled a gun on me.  We were sleeping.  My dog started barking because my fiance's puppy was annoying him (my boy is 14, quite elderly, the puppy was 3 months old).  My fiance woke up and pulled his newly purchased handgun out of the nightstand.  He stood on the bed and lined up his shot with a laser tracer in the dark.  My dog was completely unaware of the potential danger.  To him, the ""red dot"" is a game and he chases the laser pointer across the floor.  I have never shined the laser pointer on him, so I don't think he even realized it was there.  I tried to talk my fiance down, both literally and figuratively.  As I spoke to him, he turned the gun and laser tracer on me, then back and forth between me and my dog.  What I remember the most about that night, about that moment, was how calm I felt.  Looking back, I think the calm I felt was because the insanity was so common.  It didn't surprise me.  It was completely normal.  No matter how calm I felt, I knew he could kill me.  I knew that he probably would kill me if I didn't leave, but even then, I wasn't able to leave.

I remember the day I was going to visit for the weekend (after I moved away) to attend an award ceremony where he would receive an important award.  The plane ticket was already purchased.  I was already packed.  He got angry.  I can only guess there was some other trigger that I wasn't aware of because there was nothing between us that set him off.  He shouted through the phone, ""I'll f***ing kill you.""  Though he had never before verbally said he would kill me, I wasn't surprised.  His behavior was like that and after he pulled the gun on my dog and me, it certainly isn't surprising that he'd say those words.

When I broke up with him, it happened to be three days before his birthday.  He had gone out and gotten drunk four nights before his birthday.  He is not a nice drunk.  After multiple times of verbal telephonic abuse when he was drunk, I told him that he may not call me when he is drunk anymore.  I told him that I would break up with him if he called drunk and was abusive.  When he called, verbally abusive, I broke up with him, said goodbye, and hung up.  I didn't take any other calls that night.  

The next morning, he called and I took the call.  I mistakenly agreed to take him back, but it didn't even last the length of the phone call before he started the verbal abuse again and I broke up with him the last time.  He kept it a secret from everyone he knew for those three days.  He kept it secret so he could tell everyone that I broke up with him on his birthday, even though it wasn't true.  

I am so glad I am free.  I am now in a different state.  I am safe.  I don't fear for my life.  I don't know how many victims of domestic violence have options to move out of state, but I think my move was the only thing that saved me.  After I left him, it was a year and two months that he called me every day.  If I was in the same city, I wouldn't have been able to refuse his visits and he would certainly show up at my doorstep.  

To all of you who have walked away, I am extremely proud of you.  To all of you who are trying to find a way to walk away, I hope you are able to find the circumstances that allow you to leave and stay safe.  Even now, I am shocked at how manipulative abusers are and how well they trap us, their victims.  I truly don't understand why we can't break free even when we realize that we need to break free and have resources to help us, and when we finally do break free, why it takes so long to be able to do it.  

What I *do* understand is that most victims are able to identify the time that is safest to leave.  I wish for all of you who are still trapped that you are able to find the safest moment and get out.  Be prepared to leave when that moment appears.  We're all rooting for you!

Never depend on anyone,18,"I am 22 years old and since 7 years in a relationship. 

Today i had a huge fight with my boyfriend but this time I wouldn't stay quiet.
Untill today he never actually put his hands on me. But maybe he never did because I never even raised my voice. 

I never did because it's not my home here. It's his and his family home and I never wanted them to hear when we fight. I am a very quiet person in general.

I know it maybe sounds stupid but I'm on my period and I couldn't keep myself quiet with all that anger inside me. It was so bad that I had to vomit. So when I came back from the bathroom I just exploded again. I started to tell him every reason why I hate him and just called him everything that came to my mind.

He got up and started saying whatever in his language that I don't fully understand yet but he made it clear that he is going to hurt me.
I was like ""I don't care"" and I really didn't, now that all the neighbors and especially his sister have heard everything. I told him something like ""you don't really think that I am afraid of you"" sat down on the bed and was just done talking to him. 

That's when it happened. I turned my back and he pushed me like I was weightless. The bed is right next to the wall with just a little gap between and because I wasn't prepared to get pushed like that the first thing hitting the wall was my face. 

I was excited to go see my parents, my little brother and my cat. Just being home happy and loved. Since a long time my mom finally doesn't have to work this weekend. Now I can't go there or they would see my face. 

Today happened and I still won't leave. Why?

I gave up everything for him. I stopped working, I moved out of my parents house, started doing everything in his house, started to loose all my friends because I just wouldn't have time left.
I remember the 15 old girl, so fucking happy and free not knowing the big trouble she is about to meet.



Seeing other girls making a career and making their parents proud, just being able to buy whatever they need and want really rips me apart inside.

Today is really the worst of all. I was so happy to go home and now I don't even know how long this will take to heal.

I really needed to get this out somewhere and I hope there won't be too many mistakes. English is not my first language I apologize for any mistakes.

"I called CPS for my sister’s kids, and I don’t know what to do next",14,"I’m conflicted about reporting my sister’s situation to CPS, and I’d appreciate another perspective and advice on what to do next.

Background: my younger sister, Sarah*, has been with her husband, Jason*, for ~ 20 years. He is 10+ years older than she is, and she was a teenager when they met. Our family has never liked Jason, but we’ve tried to keep the peace for my sister and fear of alienating her. We saw the abusive behaviors starting to emerge when they were dating: poisoning her against us and isolating her from us and friends, control, etc. We knew it had to be her choice to leave him, so we tried to stay in her life as best we could.

In addition to the age gap when they met, Jason’s criminal history bothered us. In separate incidents, he had been convicted of possession of a firearm without a permit, disorderly conduct, furnishing alcohol to minors, and two separate incidents of assault (against two previous girlfriends). We didn’t know the extent of it when they married, but we did know about a felony kidnapping conviction (also an ex-girlfriend), for which he served time, and he said wasn’t his fault, and the whole world is against him — as usual. He’d also had dismissed charges of trespassing, disorderly conduct, burglary, and interference with a 911 call as part of the convictions above.

Shortly after they married, Sarah and Jason moved back to Jason’s hometown in another state, and they have three young children. I never visited them in all this time because Jason and I especially don’t get along, but my parents and other siblings made regular visits, and Sarah also started visiting my parents more, too, when she could with the kids, which might be once every 1-2 years. Jason has always been a deadbeat, never keeping steady employment in their entire relationship, while Sarah works two and three jobs to pay their bills. (He keeps up his delusions that he’s going to be a pro-league sports coach someday.) He is also an abusive father; between the physical abuse (which we only just now confirmed from the kids), the emotional abuse, and his toxic masculinity, he’s a grade A a-hole.

Now, the new story: last fall, my parents got a call in the middle of the night that Jason assaulted Sarah and their eldest child. (By assault, I mean nearly beat to death.) He was arrested and held in jail per their state’s statutes. Of course, my parents immediately went up there, and Sarah was finally ready to leave. (We had suspected physical abuse for a long time, but like most, she keeps secrets.) Because it was a domestic assault, CPS got involved and told her that if she went back to him, she would lose the children. Our family and friends all rallied, from taking care of all the legal stuff so she could leave the state before he was released, to installing security at my parents’ house before they returned, to getting the kids in school and therapy when she arrived, to even finding her a job when she was ready. They have been living with my parents since, who are also providing their primary financial support. With COVID and their trauma, it’s been a rough time, but we have been optimistic. She filed for divorce, and we were finally seeing some of our former sister return.

Jason was charged with two counts of assault and one for preventing a 911 call. When Jason was arraigned, the criminal court issued strict no contact orders. He immediately filed to have online visitation with their two younger children, which the court permitted with supervision. However, the court-appointed guardian ad litem petitioned to be removed from the case since the kids are out of state, and the court allowed Sarah to supervise the twice-weekly calls. 

This is where things start to fall apart. He used those calls to basically talk to my sister, and the manipulation game began again. He started breaking the court orders in other ways, too: closing their bank accounts, changing passwords to online bills, and sending the kids gifts. He finally made a big production (via social media) about going to rehab, which we found to be  some fake “poor me” camp, for a few weeks.

When he was discharged from there, things really started to escalate. Sarah started becoming even more secretive, and what little we did learn from what she shared about their divorce proceedings seemed like really, really bad advice. (We later found out via photos from an acquaintance that her divorce attorney was caught fraternizing with Jason at an event.) Jason was also calling and texting at all hours, and when we pressed her about the no contact orders, she said they filed to have them revised, and this was all authorized. We know it’s important to let DV survivors have control and not to issue ultimatums, so we took her at her word. Jason had gotten a job (for a few weeks, before he was fired) and was sending her money, which was a major issue in their marriage, and she said she was only interacting with him because of that. She also stopped the kids’ and her own therapy, which we hadn’t realized.

Big mistake. Our alarm bells started screaming when we found out Jason was coming to my parents’ town to visit the kids, and they would all be staying in a hotel. Sarah said this was all okay, but we smelled something rotten. We did our own research and called the court and attorneys in both states, and we learned the no-contact orders had NEVER been revised, and so he had been breaking them this entire time and Sarah was lying to us about it. By the time we confirmed all of this, he had left, and so our local CPS and police department said there was nothing they could do if he was no longer physically there since the case originated in another state. So we started documenting as much as we could and have been waiting these last few weeks.

However, this all came to a head these last few days. Sarah said she was taking the kids to see Jason and his parents in their hometown for spring break. We knew the no-contact orders prohibited this, so we finally confronted her with it the day before, and she LOST HER MIND, accusing of some some “agenda” and how we’re controlling her, etc. We know this is just his manipulation of her, so we didn’t engage in the fight she was starting, and she left mad with the kids. We hadn’t heard from her since.

We have been sick with worry the last few days about the kids and their safety, so I called their local CPS office and asked for a wellness check on the kids. They had the whole backstory already, and by the end of the day, they had notified police and had Jason arrested yesterday. He’s currently sitting in jail waiting to be arraigned, and the prosecutor let us know this will be in addition to the criminal charges already pending in the original incident from last year. He said Sarah was uncooperative, and he absolutely sees what’s happening re: Jason’s manipulation; he indicated that, if he has to, he’s prepared to put their eldest child on the stand to testify.

Sarah still has the kids for now (that we know of), although we’re expecting and prepared for CPS to remove them, at least temporarily. We’re worried they’re going to give them to HIS family, who have enabled Jason in everything, and we’ll never see them again. She is furious with us — especially me, since I called CPS — and says we’ll never talk to them again, we’re the ones who went around the system (not her), and all the textbook abuse-speak Jason has poured into her for 20 years. She also says we’re hypocrites for having a relationship with our parents. (Our dad had a drinking problem when we were growing up, and he’s been sober for almost 20 years. Our other siblings and I have also had a lot of therapy and conversations between us and with our parents, so we are in a much better place and have the relationships and boundaries with each other we need. And we’ve all worked damn hard to make sure we don’t repeat the cycle with our own spouses and kids. Sarah doesn’t see all of that because she’s lived in another state. She left, married this loser, and has been living in a dysfunctional family her entire life. She doesn’t know the difference.)

We know she’s humiliated, ashamed, angry, and terrified, so our family is still mostly unified and can handle what she’s throwing at us (not taking it personally). We see how she got to where she is, and we’re sad and still love her and would welcome her back with open arms when she’s ready to be done with him. But she’s not there, and we have NO IDEA what to do next. We don’t even know if she’s returning with the kids when school starts next week.

Were we right to call CPS? Should I have waited til the kids were back with my parents? We know we did the right things for the kids, but did we do the right thing for Sarah? WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!

TL;DR — I reported my sister to CPS, and they had her husband arrested and will be removing the kids from her care. We’re worried we’ll never see the kids or my sister again. What should we do?

Update: we have tried talking to the social worker at CPS today, and they won’t even tell us where Sarah or the kids are, who even has the kids, or if they’re okay, citing HIPPA. Is there anything else we can do?",Preparing To Leave
URGENT: Help writing letter to warn ex abusers new girlfriend,5,"I hope this is the right sub.

His ex girlfriend tried to warn me, not well enough, I told him what she had said and he played it off like it was nothing major - shoving her out of the way etc. I always promised myself I would warn the next woman. 

I didn't have the heart to press charges against him and when I'm tortured with memories I absolutely *hate* the thought of him doing what he did to me to another woman. I feel responsible. And it makes me feel sick.

Please help me with what to put in this letter. I'll be sending it to her through FB. 
I was physically shaking writing it. I lived with him for almost 3 years and a lot happened, so so far it's long, but articulated quite well with examples of abuse and short descriptions of fights etc. (so she can have an insight into how bad it *really* was) and ending along the lines of me begging her woman to woman that when he does put his hands on her because it will happen, to get out and not look back. 
I want her to have this information so when it happens, his true nature will become clear and she will be better prepared to leave. I will also include domestic violence organisations I was connected with so she is aware they exist. She also has children, some daughters, which I know as a mother she would never want to think that abusing a woman is okay.

Please help with ideas of anything you think is important for her to know.

Returning to work,3,"Today I go back to work after being out for nearly three months on short term disability due to the assault. I still have one more week left of the outpatient hospital program and I discharge this Friday after being in for two months. 

I’m just beyond blessed and grateful that I’ve been afforded the time and opportunity to get this type of treatment because I know many don’t have this option. 

I’ve healed a long ways but there’s still so long to go. My cptsd has flared back up even the last few days. High state of anxiety. Jumpy. It feels horrible. But it’s overall better & I don’t even know the same person I am today from December 10. I am proud of her. 

People have already been emailing me asking what happened. When I left, I just said I was going on an extended medical leave. Only my boss, HR Director and direct work teammate needed to know due my injuries and being unable to host meetings before I decided to leave for treatment. To everyone else, it was sudden and I have been gone for a long time. 

I think I will just say, “I just suffered a bad injury and been in treatment. I’m better thanks for asking.” 

I feel like I’ve been living in this whole alternate universe. I’ll be glad to return to some normalcy. Everything else is getting back on track. I’ve built back up a strong support system. I have lots of regular plans. So many good goals. I love myself again. 

I know better than to say it all gets easier from here though. If I’ve learned nothing else it’s that this stuff comes in waves. It’s a whole grieving process and you have to be prepared with a plan of action.

PSA: Legal Aid Society,1,"I wanted to share this info with anyone that needs it. 

The Legal Aid Society (they may have local branches to you, so it is worth checking out) can help you with legal assistance. 

I was referred to them by a VA social worker that I am working with in order to get my life back together post leaving an abusive marriage. 

I called them. (Be prepared for long wait times!) And I was able to talk to an intake specialist for DV related divorce. HOWEVER, due to limited resources they were unable to help me. So I am passing on this info to you because they may be able to help you. 

If you have been a victim of domestic violence within 30 days, the Legal Aid Society may be able to assist you. 

Due to the pandemic, there has been an increase in DV related incidents. And because of that, their window for the incident used to be as long as 6 months, but now it has to occur within 30 days.

Therapy can be an intimidating idea. Let me give you something to consider!,0,"Over the past several days I have found myself leaving nearly identical comments encouraging different people to seek therapy and explaining why it does not mean they have failed. Due to the nature of most posts here, I wanted to say something to all of you, to offer some insight and advice and hopefully help at least one person.

Going to therapy does *not* make you weak; acknowledging the fact that you need help and taking the steps to get it is extremely fucking strong. While the idea of therapy can be incredibly intimidating, and thinking about sharing your deepest secrets in an intimate setting with a stranger might sound like the absolute last thing you want to do after everything else you’ve already been put through, there is light at the end of this tunnel that many of us aren’t capable of seeing without someone showing us the way. I hope to do that, right now. 

First of all, the process of sharing your past with a stranger can be *extremely* cathartic. This person doesn’t know you yet from Adam, they aren’t going to judge you, they don’t know the people in your stories, and they are *on your side*. They are not going to tell you what to do or how to feel, but rather offer unbiased feedback and the tools that you need to move on. In addition to that, many people think that as soon as they sit down on a couch or in a chair in the office of their sparkly new therapist, they are going to be expected to delve in to the traumatic events they originally sought therapy for right off the bat. This simply *isn’t* true! You can start off talking about your week or your day leading up to the appointment, and get to know the therapist almost like a new friend. You can talk about legitimately *anything* that you want or need to talk about and they will listen. Sometimes it takes several or *more* appointments to get down to the nitty-gritty of what has actually fucked you up and made you *feel* broken. Occasionally, they will stop you and ask you to repeat something, and then ask you a few questions to get *you* to think more deeply about whatever that thing was before moving on. If you start specialized therapy like EMDR, you’ll have already been deemed emotionally prepared and appropriately ready to dive into your past and dig up repressed memories. You *never* have to do anything that you don’t want to do and can *always* end an intervention or treatment all together! It is important to remember parts of therapy can be *uncomfortable,* upsetting and scary, but the therapist will pay close attention to your body language, tone of voice and reactions and proceed as they deem fit and *safe.* 

Finding a good therapist is somewhat comparable to dating. When you’re looking for a significant other, do you automatically click with and move forward with every single person you go out on a date with? No! Throughout the process of finding a therapist that is right for you, you might have a few sessions with therapists that aren’t. This is *normal* and *okay*. You aren’t going to hurt these therapists’ feelings. Keep looking! Find a therapist that makes you feel you can be yourself. 

A few other things to remember: 

•Be honest! Lying will only prolong the breakthrough you’re hoping for and there isn’t any reason to do it, in this setting. 

•Be open minded. If a therapist assigns some sort of “homework” or project, do it, even if it feels silly at the time. They know what they’re doing! 

•Be yourself. You aren’t being judged. This isn’t a job interview or an assessment for some sort of promotion or background check. 

•Be *patient*. You aren’t going to unpack and find solitons for all of your issues in the first week or month. It can take *serious* time to figure out your best path to healing. If a therapist discharges you from treatment and you realize you need more help, go back! 

•Consider therapy a collaboration! You can’t do all of this alone, but your therapist can’t do the work for you, either. Work as a team. Confide in and trust them. If you can’t, talk about *that.* Talk *about* therapy *in* therapy. Outline early on what you expect and ask what they do, as well. 

If any of you ever wants to take those initial steps to finding help but aren’t sure where to start, please don’t hesitate to message me. I worked for years in mental health and substance abuse before this pandemic, and I will do absolutely everything I can to find and send you personalized and local/online resources best suited for you in regards to trauma, abuse, domestic violence and more. You don’t have to give me personal details or your life story. I’ll simply need to know where you live and what kind of money you have to spend, if any, on therapy. I’m excellent at finding little to no cost resources as well as aid in housing, job placement, continuing education and government assistance. I do this for other members of Reddit regularly and I’ll do it for you! 

Please, don’t give up. Don’t let go of yourself. Don’t write yourself off. Don’t listen to the part of your brain that’s telling you you aren’t worthy and don’t deserve to get better. You do. What you’ve been through doesn’t define you. What other people have done to you doesn’t reflect on you. You don’t have to live like this forever. Lastly, you are not alone.

Should I leave me abusive husband?,17,"I don't want this to be too lengthy, so I'll spare you guy's all the details, but basically we've been married for a little over a year now. He has done some really eff'd up things to me in the past and every time I've tried to leave, he'd find his way back into my heart. He is currently in jail and I sent him divorce papers after deciding I was done. He flushed them down the toilet, then told me that he will never give up on me and that I need to take our marriage more seriously. I left it alone after that and now we are ""doing good"" again. He swears he has changed and wishes he never put his hands on me or hurt me in anyway, and part of me believes him, and the other part of me feels like he is full of it. I love this man deeply and when he isn't consumed by his demons, hes actually a really good guy.

I'm torn because I want to see where things go when he gets out in December, but in the back of my head I have this bad feeling that he will hurt me again..or worse.

What should I do? What would you do?

If I decide to leave, I know he will make it very hard for me and not sign the papers, and I'm scared he will do something crazy. But if I stay...I'm scared he will do something crazy.

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with, and I don't know what to do. My family wants me to leave him(except my dad who really likes him), but they don't know how hard it is, and they don't really know him that well either.

Please give me advice. He really is a good guy and he practically feels like my soulmate, but I can't get over the things he has done to me in the past.

Note: Our relationship has been long distance for over a year now, so it's hard to know if he would've put his hands on me again after the last time. I really just don't know anymore. Also, he's gone to counseling and has been trying to better his life and prepare for when he get's out. I see a change in him but it's just hard to tell.

Court this Friday and possible plea deal,2,"Today I met with the district attorney to prepare for my court date this Friday. I'm trying to mentally and psychologically prepare myself for the many things that can happen, one being that there will be another bogus continuation, but also that I will need to testify. I need to word vomit so forgive me, but also would love to hear some experiences. Apologies if this gets super long.

I filed charges against my ex boyfriend months after the incident (we broke up in August and this happened in March). 

After going to a bar with my now ex and a female coworker of mine, I ended up getting quite drunk (this is speculation, but I think he drugged me based on how much I do not remember the rest of the night). An acquaintance drove me home and my ex stayed at the bar.  I went to bed when I got home and was asleep about two hours before the incident. 

Here is what my coworker has since told me, none of this I knew and/or remember from the night: After I left to go home, ex disappeared at the bar. Then, about an hour later, he popped up when she was leaving and asked if he could get a ride home from her. She agreed, and said that on the way home, he was very creepy, putting his hand on her leg while she was driving and insisting she come inside to see me/the apartment/whatever. She said she was concerned for me, so she came inside and he apparently woke me up. I came out of my bedroom, naked (which is absolutely humiliating to me). He tells me to give her a ""tour"". She leaves because she felt very uncomfortable. I remember none of this.

After she leaves, we started to fight but I don't know why. My guess is he was mad he didn't get the threesome he was clearly trying to set up. Anyway, I have a handful of flashbacks. One of him grabbing me by my hair and snapping my neck back where I was looking right into the ceiling light. Another where he threw me into a wall, resulting in one of the many holes in my walls that I woke up to see. I remember him grabbing me by my hair and me repeatedly falling on the tile floor of my kitchen. I remember falling somehow over and over again onto the tile floor, rolling in my blood, crying, while he laughed and called me a ""crazy fucking bitch"". He told me to take a shower and I fell again, several times. Then went to bed.

I wake up the next morning, it's a Friday and I have to go to work. I couldn't open my eyes, the bed was broken (foot of the bed was flat on the floor), the mattress was soaked in blood. There was blood all over the walls of every room, broken glass everywhere, my phone was smashed. He told me I did all of it and that I ""went nuts"".

Because at this time this was the start of COVID, I called in sick and was able to work from home for the near 10 days it took me to heal. My eyes were black, the swelling spanned over my entire face, my whole body but especially by butt, back and thighs were so bruised it was painful to sit.

We broke up in August and he wouldn't leave my apartment. He would not go away. I ended up getting an emergency protective order and after finally telling family and friends about this incident as well as others, I filed charges for domestic assault. 

I have provided evidence such as: a photo of me with bruising on my cheeks and wearing sunglasses a few days after the incident. The police have taken pictures of the blood stained mattress (I could never get the blood out), holes in the walls, and blood splatter that ended up on the ceiling that I could never get off. I also have a neighbor who is serving as a witness who saw me with my facial bruising when I ran into her on my street. My coworker is also a witness. 

My ex also has pending domestic assault charges with another girlfriend, just prior to me, for felony strangulation. That is terrifying to me.

He is eligible for a program as a plea deal, and I'm fine with that. I wanted him to go to jail, but he would only face up to 6 months. Plus the program would be like jail for him. He would have to do drug testing (he's addicted to cocaine and is an alcoholic, by the way), healthy relations classes he'd have to pay for and be on good behavior for two years (which he hasn't ever been able to stay out of trouble for more than a year at a time). However, the prosecutor is going to his lawyer to offer this deal to him and he can deny it. I can't see why he would want to go to trial, especially since he still has an ongoing felony charge with his ex. I don't know, I am trying to prepare myself and my story. I never thought I'd be here but I want him to have consequences. He has hurt me, his ex and so many other people and I swear he will kill someone.",Preparing To Leave
Looking for support (triggers),4,"I’m a survivor of dv. I don’t feel like I survived anything. I just left one awful situation for another. I grew up with physically abusive parents, we were lucky to get food once a day. Sometimes the food was moldy or spoiled. There was sexual abuse to my sister and I.

To escape my family I found a boyfriend. I was 16 when I ran away with him (24). He drugged me. Allowed his friends to have intercourse with me. And even made me perform while they watched. My birth control was being tampered with. I got pregnant. His was physically abusive. He didn’t even mind doing it in public as he choked me out at a bus shelter on a busy street.

I left but was quickly reticuled and scolded for it. How dare you leave your child without a father? I went back but refused to have sex with him anyway I could. It didn’t matter because I was being drugged and having sex unknowingly. It wasn’t until later I was informed that this is what happened. At 17 I was pregnant again. I was confused and accused of cheating. A dna test proved the child to be his.

I left and moved far away. I changed my name twice and then went through a complete legal identity change to hide with support of DV advocates and dhs.  I found myself in another relationship recently. My second relationship. He was controlling and abusive. Throughout the relationship I questioned my sanity. I was constantly told I was crazy. What I thought happened didn’t. I was told I was making things up in my head. I was told I needed to go to a mental hospital. I would loose things, like my keys. I would remember putting them one place but could never find them. He would do something to my car to make it not work, then claim it never happened. I just wasn’t using the car right. Later I learned about gaslighting. I went to many doctors and therapist trying to figure out what was wrong with my head.

I was impregnated by this man twice. The first time I cried. I ended up with hypermensis gravidarum. I was dying. I couldn’t eat or drink throughout my entire pregnancy. I was always in the hospital getting fluids and nutrition. It was very pain and depressing as nothing makes it better. I got no sympathy though because I was only doing this for attention. I had to work at Kmart during this pregnancy to support everyone. Including his children with other moms totaling 7 kids of his. He wouldn’t work. I was dead by the end of the day. I was frequently dizzy and puking at work. It made it hard to walk the store for 6 hours. Bending over felt dangerous. But my children depended on it.

I would come home to a huge mess. The children would want attention and had their activities I needed to take them too. Dinner needed to be prepared. Errands needed to be ran, bills needed to be paid. Grocery shopping and errands were ridiculously hard, see or smelling food or thinking about food would make me puke non stop. I had to carry the mensis bags everywhere. I couldn’t drive as I could barely walk. He drove me everywhere.

Shortly after having this baby we got into an argument over the food stamp card. He was addicted to candy and monster energy drinks. 4 a day at least. I didn’t like him using the money I have to provide for my children on candy and energy drinks. That was their food. So he attacked me for the card and took off with the baby. 

I called the cops and tried to get help, this wasn’t the first time. They told me if I didn’t drop it I will be taken to jail. I showed them bruises all over my arms. They didn’t care. I thought they just didn’t see them. Although I could feel them just fine, it was night and they were new.

I had to go the whole night without my baby. My baby was exclusively breast fed. I was very concerned but could do nothing but cry until no more tears could fall from my eyes and I couldn’t make a sound. I called the next morning when the bruises were more developed and it was daylight. I got the same response, if I don’t drop it, he will press charges (he scratched himself on his hand on the front door frame while attacking me). I was going to go to jail. I was so confused.

He went to dhs and somehow was able to get dhs to give him control over those benefits. I was so confused but every time I went to dhs to figure out what happened nobody could give me an answer. Partly because I didn’t know his ss#.

After days of going in a was able to talk to a supervisor. I had bruises up and down my arms from the attack. Dhs told me that I was reported as an abuser by him when he went in. He told them how crazy I was. He told them how I make things up in my head and need professional help. He spoke to dv advocates.

The advocates screened him out of services noting he was the abuser. He told them how he was checking my mile meter to see if I went anywhere I wasn’t supposed to and he would time me. I was unaware of this until they told me. I was aware of his suspicions because I would get in trouble a lot. I just couldn’t figure out why.

I was informed by the supervisor that dhs cannot replace the benefits or give them back to me. They said once they are issued, it doesn’t really matter who uses it, they can’t be reissued.

I was able to get the baby back and the food money by promising to be a good girl. I will do what I’m told, just bring me my baby. He came back. I was desperate to find a way out. We live in a small town. His hometown. We just moved to the area from a dv shelter. But I ended up getting pregnant again.

I was able to get enough money together to get a property and get a house moved to it. He destroyed everything I worked for. He was drinking and doing meth and decided we will go another route. He took my money and went to an auction. Then he loaded up mine and my children’s stuff from our house and moved it to the property. The first night he was seeing aliens flying over the property. We had a trailer there to stay in but I was sleeping in the cold car. In the morning he tried to kill me. We had little service, but my oldest son was able to find a signal and called 911. It was a very isolated area. The police notified us they would be at least an hour. When they got there he was inside sleeping. When he spoke to the officers he told them he wants to kill me. He was arrested.

Dhs came to check on the children to see if they needed to be removed. They were not. We were instructed to leave the property and go home. All of our stuff was gone that day. I was told by dhs not to go near him and they would help. When I got home it was a different story. His mom picked him up and instructed me to allow him to sneak in at night and to stop calling the cops.

I refused for as long as I could. Then I realized I had no help. I tried contacting dhs for support with not letting him in. They said they were not involved. He got back in and took the children, all of them. He made them each write letters saying how horrible and crazy I am. Then he took them to dhs to report me. Dhs showed up when my 4 children were there and 2 of his were there.

This isn’t the first time they had been here. Every time he stopped them from coming in. He would not allow me to speak to them. He was aggressive with them. They came to my work to talk to me and we had to have secret inspections of the house to close the case. All behind his back.

When dhs showed up this time, I stayed inside like I was supposed to. He was out there with them for an hour. Then the police came in to remove MY children. I had to load them up with no explanation. It was Friday evening. His children got to stay with me until the mothers retrieved them.

It took a month or so into the case before I was given an explanation. He told them stories of how crazy and abusive I was and gave them the letters from the children. I was heartbroken for 6 months until they were returned.

He is so dangerous that in court I was surrounded by civilians so he couldn’t get to me. Then they had to have multiple police officers attend in uniform and not. They had to have multi officers at his visitations at the dhs office to protect the workers that are protecting the children from him. He brought a hammer to court, it was suspected to be a weapon to attack me with. He has broke the restraining order many times and served a few days in jail each time. He has people calling my landlord to cause problems. He was successful. We are teetering on housing right now.

Because we live in a small town I could only get a limit distance restraining order. He lives down the street and is frequently shopping at the same stores as me at the same time.

When dhs got involved, they were required to find the other father and bring him and his family back. I have been harassed in front of my advocate by them. They know where I’m at and have made frequent visits to town. I’m scared. I’m terrified. I’m going to be killed. 

I’m trying to get out still. I have applied for other rentals. My landlord will not give me a good reference, so I have only been turned down.

Like my name says. I have been isolated, my entire life. Now I’m isolated with children. I don’t have friends or family. I don’t have social media as it’s an open book for a stalker. And who do I have to talk to anyway.

I love my children and through all this, we still have fun everyday. I cannot work right now because I’m not essential and can’t get daycare. I also do not have a work history worth anything. I know I had escaped a bad situation. But I feel like I’m leaving one bad situation for another. Is there anyway out?",Preparing To Leave
How do I prepare myself to get out?,3,"I am a year away from 18 and I've lived in a very toxic household my whole life. My father has been abusive in multiple ways to me and emotionally abusive to my mother. I don't want to leave her behind to deal with him alone, but I need to get out because my mental health is at the lowest it's been in a long time and I can hardly find motivation to get out of bed everyday. He tears me down about my weight and calls me a horrible person and daughter for stupid little mistakes and I need out desperately. The other day, my mother and I got into an argument and I told her I was leaving as soon as I'm 18 and she threatened to take me off of her medical insurance and cancel my car insurance. My question to you guys is, how do I prepare myself to be independent? I have a living arrangement planned out and I've been saving money like crazy. Any help is appreciated.",Preparing To Leave
"I just completely a research paper on intimate partner violence, and it’s killed me",14,"It’s hard to find the balance between being a psychology student, and also having ptsd from an extremely abusive relationship sometimes. 

My ex destroyed so much of my life. I had to put my studies on hold for two years, because the abuse was affecting my grades and then to start recovering from said abuse after leaving. 

This is my first year back at uni since 2017, and I’m dedicated. I’m *finally* in a place where I can completely devote myself to my studies. I’m in my final year, so the grades have a significant impact on my future. Still, I didn’t think the first assignment after my break would be on fucking domestic abuse. 

Don’t get me wrong, it was an incredibly interesting study. It looked at the links between the Dark Tetrad of Personality (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, sadism) and whether each trait predicted the perpetration of Coercive Controlling Violence, and Relational Aggression, respectively. 

Reading prior literature in preparation killed me. I had to take it so slow, with lots of breaks. And then when it came time to writing the report, and running/analysing the data, I kind of switched into fight or flight mode - my psychiatrist called it “Isolation of Affect”. I was basically able to switch off the ptsd side of my brain in order to write a killer report. I worked on it from 9am - 7pm for most of the last month. The stress helped distract me from my emotions regarding the subject, and just general life emotions. 

The report is finished now, and I’m really proud of the final product. But I don’t have anything to distract me anymore. The crash is fucking *hard*. After being in such a heightened state for a prolonged period of time, my mood is through the floor. My ptsd is flaring up *so* badly, because the impact of everything I’ve read and written has truly started to sink in. Everything feels like it’s too much. 

Still, I have to be grateful that I’m even at this point - the point at which I am safe and no longer fearing for my life; had *just* enough trauma therapy to cope; and the fact that my coping skills are on point. I wouldn’t have gotten to this point if it weren’t for my psychiatrist and two therapists, and I thank them everyday. Yes, I got myself out of that situation, but they gave me my life back by teaching me how to cope with such patience. 

Anyway. That’s my ramble. I’m proud of myself, but fucking exhausted. I hate that this isn’t just another “topic” for me - that I actually have personal experience. But it is what it is. And hopefully I’ll get to the point where it doesn’t impact me as much as it still does. 

For those interested in the results of the study, it was found that when combined, age, gender, and the Dark Tetrad significantly predicted the perpetration of Coercive Controlling Violence and Relational Aggression. Both psychopathy and sadism were unique predictors of Coercive Controlling Violence, while gender, sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism uniquely predicted Relational Aggression.

*EDIT*: I know there were comments asking to read my report before they got deleted. I appreciate the sentiment and the interest - while it does go against sub rules which align with me wanting to keep at least some level of anonymity, I’m also not allowed. The assignment hasn’t been graded yet, so posting it/sending it to people creates the very real risk that my assignment will be flagged for plagiarism. The best I can give is the results of the study, which I’ve already posted. Sorry!!!",Preparing To Leave
He Says It Is My Fault,5,"A little background: he and I have been together for about three and a half years. Things started out rocky as during our fifth date I defended him against some crazy guy that was calling us names. He got angry that he wasn't able to beat the guy up because of my interference and blamed me for years for emasculating him.

It all started with the verbal abuse. Constant put-downs, sarcastic jokes about my breasts (I am small-chested) and my sex skills. He was flirting with women from his past and online and we nearly broke up due to his trying to have an affair with a girl from his past.

We reconciled, but not before the stress drove me to a suicide attempt. He stopped me and I got therapy. However, he uses that episode very chance he gets. He would call me names like stupid and dumb cunt. I sometimes do it to him when I can't  take his attacks and he brings it up and I apologize. 

He called the guy from the fight on our fifth date a racial slur and I told him while I understand his anger, I didn't want to use that word. He accused me of defending the guy and tried to make me say it. He taunted me until I angrily slammed my dinner plate on the table. He brings that up constantly as well and made me fix the scratch on the table. 

The first time he was physical with me he called me a ""bitch."" I told him that was unacceptable and at that point was done with the relationship and told him calmly to pack his things and get out. He brought up the suicide attempt and then crowded me into a corner. When I wouldn't back down, he pushed me onto the bed and held me down. He then started calling me a bitch over and over again. Afterwards, he just claimed he was angry for what I had said to him and that I seemed ""aggressive,"" and that he was afraid I might hurt myself. 

The next time he did it, we were arguing about his fidelity. I admit, I was accusing him about certain things that were later unfounded. He stated that he had been trying to change and I wasn't allowing him the chance, and I admit, he had gotten therapy and things seemed better for a while. However, I was still angry and walked away from him while he was explaining why he didn't do what I thought he did.

I gave him a sarcastic ""okay whatever,"" chuckle. I went into the kitchen and was preparing steaks and cutting up veggies. He saw the knife in my hand and said in a sarcastic tone ""How do I know you aren't going to use that on yourself? Maybe you're feeling suicidal. Maybe you are going to threaten me."" I rolled my eyes and kept cooking and snorted. Then he ran up, slammed my head against the wall and told me not to laugh at him again. Then he pushed me against another wall and began choking me until I couldn't breathe. He taunted me the whole time, saying, ""Oh cough all you want you did this to yourself.""

He let me go and I ran into the living room and he came behind me and put me into a jujitsu choke hold and bit my ear. He let me go and then threatened to leave. For some strange and inexplicable reason, I panicked. I couldn't imagine my life without him and I begged him to stay. 

He stayed but at first he denied choking me. Then he says he didn't remember doing it and that we should ""agree to disagree that we had different versions of what happened."" Now he doesn't deny it but says he did it to protect me from hurting myself because I was cooking with a knife in my hand. 

I went to go fill out a police report and lost the courage. His family and mine are intertwined and I couldn't do it. Now he says that if I tell people no one will believe me and he keeps insisting that I was brandishing a knife and I'm sure that's what he will tell people. He says I should never have started the argument with him and it's my fault.

Need Help,5,"I have been working with my local DV organization since the beginning of April. I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account. 

I am afraid something will happen to my cats because his sister (who is there not on the lease) has a history of animal abuse. What can I do? I'm afraid the police won't help me.


UPDATE:

It went abysmally. Despite being the primary on the lease I was denied entry to the home. It was bad enough his sister got in my mother's face and threatened her so I had to call the cops. I did record everything and got him admitting to both going through my email and making a copy as well as the landlord confirming the details of the abuse I had called and spoke with them about. I wanted to doe then and there.

Last year my state updated the law to include documentation from a mental health professional or a domestic violence advocate as accepted documentation to present your landlord to be allowed put of the lease without penalty. It was explained to me by my DV team that was to help people like me who got everything under the sun but a hand laid on them. Despite multiple attempts to reach out and educate my landlords, I am still going through a process with them allowing me to leave. It has escalated to the point the police and the DV attorneys are getting involved. None of that helps though when they disclosed all details I sent them to him. Because I had updated and added a 2-factor authentication to my email after I suspected he had access before. The details he was able to hurl at me had to have come from them.

The worst thing is the police told me that I have to wait until one or the other of us takes it to court to get my belongings. I tried to show proof of ownership but they wouldn't let me. Nor would they let me in the home for anything. And since he promises to sue me for defamation of character, all while parading the fact he is a jailer and is protected by the sheriff's office, I am having to prepare for the event he will actually have the guts to follow through. I think it would be incredibly stupid of him but yesterday proves that he is not above doing idiotic things in the name of hurting and humiliating me.

I voiced my concern and worry for my animals to the police and cited the fact she has been known to hurt them. They said it would still be a court matter. My advocate assured me they would do what they could since there was the possibility of animal abuse as well. I know him and his family and know that they're not above dumping or hurting the cats to make sure I cannot have them. I wasn't even able to see them yesterday as he hurled insults and claimed I abandoned them. I couldn't go back to get them until I was safe and had a plan. 

It is a mess and I have to go to work today and try to keep it together. My bosses know what vehicle down to the license plate to look out for because he intends to try to get me fired in an attempt to carry out an earlier threat to financially ruin me. I cannot help but wonder sometimes if I had simply stayed quiet instead of breaking it off with him would I have been able to get more things done when I am at this point now.",Preparing To Leave
My Escape from My Abuser (steps),17,"I thought this might be something that helps another person in my situation.  Please be aware, that I was not married to my abuser, nor did we have children or a mortgage, so I realise that my situation is not as difficult to get out of.  However, if you’re feeling overwhelmed this might be a good starting point.  

This is also helpful for me to just get this stuff out there.  So thank you. 


STEP ONE: TELL SOMEONE 

The first step I took was telling someone.  It was in part to seek help, but my primary motivation was to have someone external that I was accountable to.  I wasn’t able to rugsweep his abuse once I had set that ball rolling. 

Now who you tell is important.  You need this person to be supportive, but you also need them to be discreet.  If you’re leaving, a lot of people will have the knee-jerk reaction to be a white knight.  

You know the type, the ones that want to kick the door down and beat up your abuser.  These are usually the people that, while having the best intentions, are most likely going to make your situation 1000% worse.  

Remember, the most dangerous time for the person in an abusive relationship is when they are leaving it.  And the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  

You need to tell people who will be your Seal Team Six.  The ones who will keep it quiet, support you where they can, and if they are part of your “extraction team” they will be in, out, and done.  No drama, No confrontation. No fights. 

Confrontation might make the white knights in your life feel better, but they often don’t realise you just want to get out alive.  They don’t realise that you’re probably still half in love with your abuser.  Your mind is garbled up.  You don’t need people attacking your abuser (either verbally or physically) because in your mind your abuser is still the person you love.  You just don’t love the abuse.  

You need this person to have their focus be 100% on you and your wellbeing.  Communicate this or even send them what I’ve written here to express it to them.  

A lot of potential white knights in my life had to be calmed down.  It wasn’t a task I enjoyed doing, but it was necessary.  Most people don’t have any clue how to react in this scenario.  Be forgiving of that.  But do not let them put you in further danger. 


STEP TWO: THE BUG OUT BAG 

My bug out bag wasn’t even a bag.  I had simply hidden away my passports, some money, the spare key to my car and an emergency credit card in a hidden place.  I kept it tucked away in the bookshelf that I would need to go past if I had to run for the door (in case he went into another rage).  Keep it in a place he won’t find it, and make sure its not a place where you’ll get cornered if you have to go fetch it.  


STEP THREE: FIND YOUR LODESTONE

This step was necessary for me to remember who I was before the abuse, before the gaslighting and self-doubt, before I had been essentially broken down into this terrified shell.  

Your lodestone should be something that you can cling onto while the waves of self-doubt wash over you, when you think maybe it wasn’t that bad, or that things might get better.  Your emotions will be a cyclone during all of this.  We’ve all gone through or seen people undergo a break up.  People dealing with heartbreak are a mess.  You are in this position with a whole host of other terrifying factors.  Its natural to feel confused and overwhelmed.  My functionality during this time was negligible.  

My lodestone was from a simple joke I used to make.  I used to always say I would never take a bet that I wouldn’t win.  This was in reference to usually betting $20 on a hockey game.  I had to reason with myself that if I wasn’t going to bet $20 freaking dollars, why on earth would I be willing gamble with my life, on the off-chance that he wouldn’t lose control again?
 
Find something simple for you to hold onto.  Something that reminds you of who you are.  It doesn’t need to be anything huge or deeply philosophical.  It just needs to be a little lifesaver ring to hold onto while there is this torrent of emotions around you.  

Remember, your abuser may turn on the charm after an episode.  They may be apologetic and loving. 

I was rather lucky in that my abuser was in such hard denial that he refused to go to therapy.  
Refused to quit drinking.
Refused to even properly apologize (sorry buddy, but saying I “provoked you” into strangling me because we were in a fight isn’t going to fly as a legitimate apology). 

Don’t let them make you forget what they did to you.  It’ll get harder to stay angry when the physical signs of the abuse fade, or if there were none to begin with.  You have known yourself your entire life.  You didn’t make up that fear, that pain, that feeling in your gut.  Your brain is trying to cope and you’re most likely in shock.  My emotions didn’t get unblocked until a good two months later and its still ongoing.  


STEP FOUR: GRAY ROCKING/ 50s HOUSEWIFE 

This step is incredibly difficult.  You need to act like everything is normal until everything is place.  There are moments where your emotions may get the better of you.  

The weekend before I left I got lucky because my period hit (woohoo no surprise baby to worry about, and I had an excuse for having my emotions be a little off the rails).  I used my hormones as an excuse for why I was crying.  However, I did NOT let on that the tears were from stress, depression, panic, and simply being completely overwhelmed.  

I pretended my tears were from me being so moved about adorable dog rescue videos and heart-warming stories online.  My abuser was mildly bemused, but he accepted this.  You know yourself better than anyone else does.  Work out a cover that works for you. 

Sometimes you can’t control your emotions, but you can control what your abuser believes the root cause of these emotions are. 

Do not engage in anything that will make him angry.  It made me sick to do this, but I was sweet and loving and made dinner on time, and kept the house clean.  I didn’t encourage any of his rages, but I also listened when he was heated.  If you get overwhelmed, sometimes you can get away with faking an illness.  Sometimes its easier if you pre-empt by pretending you’re already sick.  


STEP FIVE: PREPARING FO RAPID DEPARTURE 

You need to take steps for your departure.  For me, this meant PLANNING.  I needed to think about all my contingencies. 
I had a dog.  I was in another country.  We had a joint bank account.  I was planning to ghost him, so I wanted there to be no reason that I had to get into contact with him.  

It was during this phase that I thought the worst of him.  It wasn’t that I thought he would trash my credit in a vendetta.  But I also never thought he would strangle me like that. So at this point I had to accept that maybe I didn’t know him at all and therefore, in order to protect myself, I needed to think the worst of him.  

So I secretly began to go through our things under the guise of tidying up the house.  I secretly separated out all of our documents.  In drawers where we kept joint winter clothing, I separated my stuff onto the left and his things onto the right.  I did the same with the books and other areas where our things co-mingled. 

For packing, I secretly packed 90% of my clothing into suitcases and kept the suitcases where they always were.  I left out enough clothing in drawers and even hung up his unused formal clothing into my closet, so on a quick glance it looked like all my clothes were still there.  This meant the day I left my packing job took me under an hour. 

For the dog, I took steps to ensure that she was legally in my name.  I updated her registration and microchip so that I was the sole owner.  I did not update the address because I wanted there to be no way for him to track where I was going.  I spoke to the vet’s office and got her put under my name only.  I took off his name and his family as “emergency contacts.” I got her paperwork in order to bring her across the border with me.  

For the car, I got it tuned up since I was going to be driving it across the country with me.  

I rang the post office because when I put the mail forwarding in place, I wanted to ensure that my new address was not going to be broadcast to him in any way shape or form.  

Everything I needed to search for in google was done in incognito mode.  I was leaving no trace that I was going to leave his ass.  
I even cleaned out the car that weekend so that was one less thing to worry about.  Think about anything you can do that will make your escape easier without raising any alarm bells. 


STEP SIX: LEAVING 

I was lucky that one of my good, long-time friends was prepared to fly out and do the drive back with me.  I had the day picked out when I knew my abuser was going to be out at work, when I would have the house to myself to pack, and that I would have a few good hours to put plenty of distance between myself and him.  

My friend flew in the night before and spent the night at the airport (an absolute angel of human being), before taxiing over immediately when the coast was clear.  And then we started packing like mad. My friend was in charge of tetrising the luggage in the car.  My job was sprinting around the house and piling all of my things at the front door.  I had to leave a few things behind, but I had already accepted that I might not be able to take everything.  

Then we went to the gas station and filled up the car.  It was the last time I was going to use the card on the joint account for anything. There was no way I was going to leave a paper trail for him to follow.  

Then I went to the post office and set up mail forwarding to my new address. 

Then I went to the bank and drained the joint bank account (in cash), closed the account since most joint accounts allow you to do that unilaterally, and separated out half of it.  I took my half and he got his half.  (I had some guilt about taking the money since he was working while I was waiting on my work permit to come through.  I justified this be realising I had given up years investing in this guy and had moved to a foreign country for him.  Taking my half of our finances from our shared and now tattered life was the LEAST he owed me.  I took half because I knew I needed some finances to get myself back on my feet, so I couldn’t take nothing. But I also couldn’t take all of it because the last thing I wanted was him coming after me legally for his half of the money.  Just do it 50-50, be fair about it and don’t give your abuser the option of coming after you for any reason.  Be FAIR even if it’s hard to be the bigger person). 

I left his money in an envelope on the table, left the key in the lock box, and hit the open road.  

After five hours, I sent his father a text message saying politely that his son had strangled me, that I fled without him knowing, and to please look after him.  I also thanked his dad for looking after me.  

I kept casually talking to my abuser on messenger until I knew he was coming home from work.  Then I blocked him. That was last time I have spoken to him.  I have no replied to any of his emails or any of his harassing of my friends to get me to contact him. 


STEP SIX: HIDING

I lay low at my friend’s house for a few weeks after I left.  I didn’t want to go to any of the usual places my abuser would expect me to go to (mutual friends of ours, my family, etc).  I picked a friend who my abuser didn’t know and definitely didn’t know the home address of. 

I didn’t even tell my family the exact address.  I let my parents know what town I was in and that was it.  None of my friends knew what location I had gone to.  This isn’t because I thought they would betray me to him.  This is because a small innocuous slip-up could have led him straight to my friend’s door.  I went underground and the most people were getting from me was that I was safe. 

As far as my abuser was concerned, I could have gone anywhere in the world and that’s exactly what I wanted him to think.  I most definitely DID NOT hide in the obvious places (like my parent’s house).

5 years out and PTSD - Finally telling my story,1,"We met back in 2009 when I was 22 and he was (what I thought) also 22 as well...let's call him A. I had recently come out of a year long relationship with a severe alcoholic (nice guy but completely falling apart) and found A to be amazingly refreshing. He had a job, his own place, and was so charming and sweet. We were both poly-drug users, basically taking whatever we could get our hands on, but we had a fun, care-free life for the first few months. We hung with lots of friends, he cooked for me alI the time, and we did a lot of fun things. I was sleeping on my mom's couch at the time, so it made some sense why we moved fast and started living together quickly. 

The first red flag was when I looked at his driver's license and realized he was a year younger than previously stated. I was pretty weirded out, and when I confronted him, he literally jumped out a one-story window and ran away for an hour to avoid me. Wtf? I figured he thought I wouldn't be interested in him if I knew he was younger. I let the lie slide and then other red flags were dropped here and there as we went. 

He confided that his last girlfriend was ""crazy"" and had burned him with a flat-iron as well as falsely called the police on him for hitting her. I couldn't imagine him doing that at all at the time, and believed all his bullshit.

 About 6 months in, he started acting real off and suicidal. Like he always needed to be entertained and if I couldn't find something to do or some drugs to take he would either guilt-trip me and sulk or become scarily agitated. I noticed he was drinking ALOT, about a bottle of whiskey a day. He started telling me things like ""shut the fuck up"" and ""fuck you"" regularly, which I had never experienced from a loved one before. I kept trying to talk with him rationally and tell him how much he was hurting me. I assumed he was very troubled and that I could help him. Ha! Very naive of me. I always tended to be a helper or caregiver in my previous personal relationships. 

When he would get agitated or angry, his pupils would dilate and it was like he was someone else. He started regularly threatening suicide and one day I came home from work to find him foaming at the mouth after claiming he drank household cleaner. It was all a show. I got his mother involved several times during his suicide ""attempts"". The first time he hit me, I actually ended up comforting him because he managed to turn it around and make me feel sorry for him, because he felt like he ""ruined everything"". He was eternally the victim.

 The awesome job I thought he had was just him doing ac work for his dad (who is an even worse person than A) and they fought regularly, so the work wasn't consistent. We moved several times, breaking leases along the way, with my parents supplementing what they could with my minimum wage job. He began regularly threatening to burn our house down when he was upset. If we argued in the car while he was driving he would start going 100 mph, driving erratically or tailgating, and make me feel like I was about to die. One time, he pulled over on a highway overpass, threatened to jump, and then when I tried to stop him he hit me repeatedly and bit me on my thigh. I lived in constant fight-or-flight for those first two years after the initial honeymoon period. I was routinely put-down, hit, choked, bit, very hardly tickled, and pinned down. I would have sex when I did not want to just so he would maybe be happy that day. 

His mood ruled everything. Mind you, I was too terrified and embaressed at the time to tell anyone but A's mom what I was going through, and she didn't even know most of the details. My step-father, a retired police officer, informed me that A had stolen from him and pawned the items. I knew I had to leave A because my dad has always helped me a lot, and I respect him more than anyone, and I did leave for 3 months.

 During that time, I was a still-jaded mess. I did many drugs, got myself fired from my job, and put myself in a lot of dangerous situations. Previously that same year, one of my best friends died very violently and I used that and A as an excuse to get high out of my mind. January 2011, A and I got back together. To this day, I really don't know why I went back. He was sweet again, he was who I thought he always could be. I thought he had worked on himself.

 A month later, I found out I was pregnant. I had already stopped taking drugs before A and I got back together, so I just started hyper-focusing on preparing to be a mother. I was 24. A had a part-time job doing valet at night and we moved in with his mother in her one-bedroom house because again, he couldn't be bothered to work anywhere more than a month. I was able to get my previous job back and worked my butt off preparing for our little girl. A started coming home really late, lying constantly, doing drugs secretly, and when confronted, turned into the same old monster. He knocked me down to the ground several times while I was pregnant and threatened harm and death to me and everyone I loved. He always had bad things to say about my friends so that I felt I couldn't have them around. I remember vividly having to go sleep with his mom in her bed to escape him many times while 8-9 months pregnant. He treated his own mother like shit too. She was abused by his father for 20 years (but now divorced) so I guess that is why she just would never tell him to gtfo. I suppose she feels responsible for what he has become because his father is very similiar. 

I cried and cried for the situation I was bringing my daughter into and yet still could not find the courage to leave. I felt like he would hurt me or himself if I left, and even though I hated his guts, I still cared for his well-being. My daughter arrived and he left the hospital several times to go home and drink. He took all of the pain meds the hospital sent me home with. When she was 2 weeks old, he hit and choked me while I was holding my newborn, and I had to set her on the bed while we fought and wrestled right next to her. I would usually fight back, but realized early on never to start the violence.

 That's how it went for the next 3 years. He has lifted me off the ground by my neck, spit in my face, threw things at me that made me bleed, left bruises, dislocated my jaw, and I have had to wrestle and hide his shotgun away from him many times...I went through a lot. I knew for a long time I needed out, but I just didn't know how to break free. I would take my daughter and stay at my mom's when it got real bad and one day while there, I decided to apply to community college.

 I was 28. Something in my brain switched. He told me I should quit during my first semester, but instead, with my new found freedom in schooI, I finally quit him. I met another man during that time, and although I should have ideally given myself time alone to heal, we have been together ever since (going on 5 years) and have a son together. He treats me like a partner should, and even though it's been 5 years since I have experienced A's violence, I still cry regularly, have nightmares and flashbacks, and have extreme anxiety and aversions to certain touches, tickling and yelling. I battle extreme misplaced anger and sometimes feel like I act like he used to in some ways, like yelling when upset and abusive intimidation to my children. I want to heal and move on but I am bitter and pissed off! I do not have the means to goto therapy as i have no health insurance. I literally wish he would just die. I know that is not healthy, but it is what it is. In 2016, he moved across the county without informing or saying goodbye to his daughter. He hasn't seen his daughter since she was 4, and once a year or so when he is in town, emails me (the only communication I will allow) to try to see her. I don't want that monster anywhere near my child, and I have a visceral reaction when he tries to contact me.

 He emailed yesterday and that's why I'm telling my story. I don't want to be the bad guy and keep my daughter from her dad, but I don't trust a single cell in his body with my precious child. I tried to let him have her when he wanted the first year (she was 3) against my better judgement but he proved time and time again that he couldn't keep a stable home, job, be sober, or be a consistent parent. Legally, he could just come get her with a police officer if he wanted visitation but he has a warrant and that is what keeps him away. He has never provided support and evaded all attempts for child suppport courts to serve him. I am about to graduate community college and apply to nursing school and her (step-) dad is the best papa she could ever have. I do believe I suffer from PTSD and would love to hear of any resources for free help in South Texas that you may know of. I am tired of letting this person have control over my emotions.

"Revisiting custody, I have court next week and am trying to prepare...",1,"Soooooo, in June of 2018 my extremely abusive, raging narcissist of an ex-husband (husband at the time) literally kicked my 8 yo son and I out of our house, dumping us on my parents, stole MY car, and ran away to NYC to become a rockstar and shovel heroin into his face. Don't get me wrong,  I was in the midst of a plan to leave anyway, so when he left me instead it was just a complete and total relief, but my son, it killed him. I had to get an order of protection because my ex kept harassing and threatening my family and I in any way he could. Before he left for the city he actually had the cajonès to corner and threaten me at court! For custody! Then left! So of course I got sole custody, DUH!
The decade of emotional abuse and incessant verbal berratement have now left me with complex PTSD that I am being treated for. I feel like I am in this bubble of tar, just stuck to his abuse. He's a fucking incubus. He sucked me dry. 
Since around August he has been having supervised visitation once a week. Last week I got a petition from court against me stating that he wants more rights to his son now. He wants him alone.
So, naturally I have started preparing for court. I am going through ALL the messages, emails, audio recordings I took as proof of abuse, EVERYTHING I have to make a case against him, and now I am just plain petrified that he will succeed in getting MY son, MINE, alone to manipulate and gaslight. I have witnessed him gaslighting my son already on the phone, with me supervising! What will happen when they're together?
I'm listening to recordings of my ex telling my son to ""shut the fuck up"", that he is ""an asshole"", ""a jerk"", ""spoiled"", you name it. That he has hit my son numerous times. Then there's the fact that I found heroin baggies in my sons play area. There's that lovely tidbit. 
My ex has PROMISED to show my son all the petitions of past orders of protection I have had to take out against him, because of course I'm a statistic that has gone back to her abuser multiple times. He has PROMISED to turn my son against me. He wants him to hate me. I have it all recorded and just heard it over again with my son crying and screaming at his dad in the background. 
What am I supposed to do? These men DO NOT CHANGE. What if he wins? What if he gets ahold of my beautiful, compassionate, wonderful boy? I am so beyond scared right now. Idk what to do. I really don't.",Preparing To Leave
Is healing a possibility? Can we move forward?,8,"Little background info, my[M29] wife[F30] and I have been married for 3 years and together for 7. When we first began dating we were long distance and when fights would occur they were get heated but it was easy to just stop answering or texting back... fast forward about 8 months, she is pregnant and moving across states to be with me so we can raise a family. Once we are in person, the fighting was still there and much harder to avoid... it would start off small, then snowball into something huge to the point where she would push me or throw something at me and also verbally abuse me, calling me the worst things she could think of and telling me things like “you’ll never meet your daughter I’m leaving” and things that are in that same ballpark. Things stayed like that for majority of the pregnancy, but almost completely subsided once our daughter was born and she went on antidepressants. We would have the occasional fight, usually when she would stop taking her meds for whatever reason, and it would always go back to that physical and verbal place - throwing things at me and shoving me, and back to the same verbal abuse... again, it would subside and things would be good, but there was always that fear that she would stop taking her meds... when would it happen again? Is our daughter safe in that environment? Beyond mentally, which it isn’t okay, is she physically safe? I was scared. 

That brings us to last year around this time. Things were stable, for the most part. My own depression got pretty out of hand after a very close cousin of mine was sent home on hospice, just waiting to die from cancer. My depression manifested in weird ways, very suicidal and always fearing impending doom... I would hurt myself, never anyone else. My wife was pretty supportive through my cousin’s decline and eventual death, but was struggling to be there for me the way I needed during my depression. 

A whole slew of things happened and eventually she stopped taking her medication... queue the pattern... huge fights, name calling, shoving, throwing things at me, but now she started to also hit me. I am fully capable of defending myself and would protect myself from any real physical harm, but the emotional and mental harm was unbearable. I told her so many times after things would calm down that it had to stop, she couldn’t be behaving that way and that I wasn’t going to allow it any longer... she kept calling my bluff. We kept fighting, things were awful, and she kept on with her abusive pattern. I don’t want to relive the details, but the worst of it was when she threw a set of keys at my face and hit me just above the eye leaving an actual mark for the first time ever. I was terrified and angry and sad. I told her it could not, and would not, happen again. That I would leave if it did. She called my bluff again. Pushed me, shoved me, name calling... 

I can’t even remember how many times this happened over the course of a few months. It was fairly frequent. Through working with my own therapist I was eventually able to learn to set a firm boundary and I told her that if it happened again, instead of leaving, I would call the cops. Through our couples therapist we learned to put in a safe word for if a fight was getting out of hand. One afternoon a fight was beginning to get out of hand. I told her we needed to stop and I used the safe word... “pineapple”. She kept going and going and wouldn’t stop or calm down, I could see the writing on the wall, I knew what was going to happen. I kept saying “pineapple” over and and over again and she wouldn’t listen. She was blind with rage. She cornered me in the bedroom as I was trying to get some dirty laundry, I needed a distraction and I chose cleaning. She punched me multiple times, pushed me into the wall, was calling me all the names in the book and explaining to me how much she hated me. Meanwhile I am shouting “pineapple”.

I was finally able to get out of the small bedroom, laundry in hand. I go to the laundry room, which is in the kitchen of our tiny home, and she follows me out, continuing to verbally abuse me. I choose to ignore it and go about my distraction of doing laundry. As I try to get out of the kitchen she picked up the dining room chair and was preparing to throw it at me. I told her boldly that I was calling the cops. I pulled out my phone, dialed 911, and then she finally hit the pause button and understood what was happening - that I wasn’t bluffing this time. 

She instantly freaked out, said I couldn’t do this to her, that I was going to get her arrested, that I was going to ruin her life. I ignored all of that. I didn’t feel guilt or shame in what I was doing. I was proud of myself for finally sticking up for me. The police did not arrest her, however they informed her that if there was ever another call she would be taken regardless of what I said or wanted. 

Since then the abuse has stopped. This was in November, roughly 5 months ago. My own therapist explained to me that my feedback was not working, however the consequences seems to have gotten the severity of it into her head. I can see the logic between feedback and consequence, and I do think that hit home for her, but obviously my fear is still there. Despite things being good, I am afraid for myself at times and afraid of what happens if we fight. 

My question is, can we ever move forward? I want to trust her so badly, I want to believe that this put the fear of god in her... I want to believe that we can have a stable marriage. Is it a possibility?? I have never been a victim and do not know any - is growth a possibility? Is there any chance to rebuild? Is there hope? ",Preparing To Leave
Tough appointment with a woman who is currently living what I lived.,2,"I work as a behaviour support clinician, and I met with the Mum of two of my clients today after she dropped off the radar for a couple of months. 

She is late 30's, with an 11 year old who is currently exploding with anger (not my client), and two younger children both with level 3 ASD. 

It was three hours of counselling her and teaching her about the cycle of abuse. What she told me was exactly what I lived for 9 years (and still being manipulated 18 months after I called the police and broke up with him (4 years in the making). It was uncanny. The events that led to our DVOs were almost identical. 

We had only intended to meet for an hour, but one thing led to another and I feel so privileged that I could give her validation and support. I've offered for her to have mail sent to the office as she makes preparations, and she's coming in each week (sometimes twice a week) with one or both children. I told her that this is a safe place for her. If she needs to make phone calls, she can freely without having to account to her partner and face his interrogation. 

I had to leave for my second job shortly afterwards, and my ex started messaging me asking if I would be home this afternoon, demanding to know what time I would be leaving work. Saying ""You can see how that makes it difficult for me to know what to do"" because he wanted to come over after work. 

I reflected on what I'd spoken about and taught this woman today, and I felt angry that he was trying to guilt me into doing what he wanted. 

I'm feeling pretty emotionally hungover and upset about the situation. I feel so angry for her. I feel so angry about my history.

My eyes are open...I'm awake,13,"Only a few days ago I accepted that I am in an emotionally abusive relationship. Seems odd even typing those words.
I'm lucky and I have an amazing therapist who supported me to find this outcome myself. Her advice, keep yourself safe and prepare things in the background. 
Initially the thought of leaving made me sick, I cant do it, and don't want to. But now whilst trying to get this back to normal after the most recent argument which was of course my fault, as  I have been told so many times, I find I am withdrawing, I'm not cuddling, kissing, or even talking normally. The thought of leaving still terrifies me, no children thankfully but we own a home. 
I think there is still part of him I love, I think that if I leave he will be heartbroken or change. I also know this is textbook DV response.

Can someone just reassure me that withdrawing but not being able to leave is normal? 
Does he know he's doing this to me?",Preparing To Leave
"All the shades of abuse, how he cut me off from anyone, from himself and instead encouraged a introduction with his emotional affair partner",0,"His abuse is not just physical and psychological, he abuses me by social disconnection. I guess he feels shame and realizes in small corner of his mind how monstruos he behaves so he simply cut me off. His mom didn't see me for last two years. He blame me yet he knew that I would not go after his abuse because I can't speak with this woman looking her into her eyes and omit the fact how awful her son is, especially because she endures abuse from him, and her husband, too.

He cut me off from some people in his life by spreading lies about how I'm mentally ill. My mom is schizophrenic and I've made a mistake when I confessed that to him in beginning of our relationship. Now he regularly hits in a weak spot by telling me that I'm crazy, that I hear voices. His friend looked at me with some mix of fear, disgust and aleterness the last time he spoke to me, and the last time when he was here, on the birthday of our kid, he didn't say a thing to me. 

I made a cake for our apartment owner, I don't know right term how you call people from who you rent an apartment. She has my phone nb but she decided to reply to him about my cake. He didn't bother to transfer what she said.

Finally, he has a neighboor with whom he is close, she is sexually attractive and flirts with him for I don't know how long, they know each other three years while our own relationship only degraded further in that time, and between them two grew.

I found his messages to her. They are sexual teasings:

*Him: Hi, how is it going?

She: Good. I don't know what to prepare for lunch today. I don't have cigarettes. 

She: How are the kids?

Him: They are in grandma backyard, clap-clap [as approval]. Make a soup. It's healthy.

She: Is it not dangerous to bring kids to grandma now? She is old. [covid19]

Him: don't ... [as in don't bother me]

She: okay, I won't

She: I saw your wife outdoor with kids.

Him: She can go to school yard few steps away but she won't go with them in a walk around block.

She: At least she went out :laughing to tears smiley:

She: What book are you reading?

Him: I'm reading Bukowski, he is fucking a lot, he writes short but witty.

She: all you think about is fucking, poor Noahloahboah :laughing smiley:

Him: please, don't

She: clap clap :three laughing to tears smileys: [this completely changes its earlier meaning more towards slap-slap, as in slap from behind in sex]

Him: children playground at noon? [with kids]

She: no, i'm afraid of covid19 and kid is sleeping.

Him: covid19 party

She: hahha*

If she teases him and provoces responses that much in text messages I can expect, now that I've seen, what she does in person. She constantly triggers sexual associations. Their whole interaction comes to that because I've noticed he doesn't know some common information that people who hang that much would knew about. I guess they solely speak in sexual conotations and poke each other.

I was crushed emotionally when I read that. I was hurt and mad. And I annoyed him about him mocking me with her, referring to incident in Feb, when she took visit to our home, for kids to play, and she said to me, again as a sexual insinuation, after being curious about how we met and I said it was food that joined us:
- So, you like pizza (which is another meaning for pussy in our language)? Here she starts giggling, laughing for several minutes.
He comes, stands in fron of her, and claps to her with his hands, giving her appraisal for the ""excellent joke"" and calls her with specific name people use here when you pown someone. She continues laughing. 

Later in kitchen, she told him ""Something is boiling down here."" referring to oven, but with extended laughing it again switches to sexual implication, because it has double meaning in our language.

Lastly, she asks me whether we as a family would come to her place next time, I reply with ""See this with him"", and she goes playfully to him, and says: ""Your wife said I should ask you to agree for a play"", and again extended giggling and laughing. She acts as a horny teenager. I remember when all my collegues were capable to talk about in high school were just such jokes. And the ones who were more into it were actually signalizing they are more than ready to have sex. I also doubt she has some insecurities is she feels a need to slam someone she barely knows. Last thing is, he says about her that she knows everyone in neighborhood. If that's true she must have heard thst he is an abuser. Why is she that interested in him then?

I complained these days a lot and poked him, and I bite, and I cried. He was defending himself with ""It's not your business."" and tons of insults, and at rare moments with ""There's nothing between me and that woman."", ""We never met together."". He said that this how they speak and how them two speak with me is a completely normal discussion and why haven't I met someone and invited. I wanted to invite my school friends ten ten years ago but I decided I don't want them to meet him because he would probably be rude, and they would understand he is an asshole. I don't like type of people he likes. He would not socialize nor accept people I do.

A day after my birthday he could not handle all these accussations well, after he found me smoking a cigarette [on a window] and crying at 3 am, after which he threw up in toilet for next 20 minutes at 4 am [since he drinks alcohol daily] and then when I wanted to take dogs in a walk he stopped me, he said he will. I took water and a wiper and got myself to clean floor. Here he comes 15 minutes later and tells ne he will wipe the floor and that I should go with dogs. Or whatever I want from that two. I said I'll go with dogs, and later take kids and he can lie down as a lazy ass. Here he goes mad. Tells me that I should not take kids in a walk anymore. That hurt me since I read his messages where his emotional affair partner mocks me. I go mad and reffer all back to her. He got down on me, hit me in my back, legs, punched me with his fist right into middle of my chest, hit me on my head several times, broke my eardrum [I hope it's only that since I don't hear now on right ear well].

With people with whom he doesn't speak, our building, he expresses some even fearfull reactions. Like, when he discovered that our first neighboor talks about his abusiveness around to people. He immediately told me that I can choose between him or her, and if I choose her he will be my enemy. As if he is not now.

Our second neighboor gave clothes to our kid. Handed it to him. I wanted to knock down on the doors and thank for it and give back piece of barbie doll clothes that stuck with clothes. He freaked out.

Third neighbors he cut off due to giving beer to their three year old, allegedly. I'm not sure about that because they seem normal, and the woman is a teacher. I suspect they've told him something about him abusing me and maybe he just doesn't want to be ashamed further.

Our other neighboor had fire in his apartment but he seems as a good person. My partner talked shit about him.

A woman who works in fast food near us, came to our apartment once, was nice with me, always said hello. He talked shit about her, too.

Lastly, a guy who comes from place where my partner's mom comes, doesn't even greet me when he sees me.

Finally, he locked down his phone, not telling me a slight sense about where has he been with kids, I'm excluded and cut of from his mind and life as a cancer. He is just keeping me here while kids are too young.

This is toxic environment. He is narciss, psychopat, sociopath, abuser. I want to leave and I can't. I'm broke. We are all in middle of this covid19 crisis. I don't know how to deal with this shit in front me. I endured his abusiveness somehow till the point that he is wide openly jerking on a woman that lives in next building. For three years. He thinks he doesn't have anything with her just because he didn't stick his dick yet, although he did that thousands of times already in his mind, probably every time we had sex together.

I'm weak, broken, ashamed, slamed to the bottom.

Fake it until you make it (out)? Write a goodbye letter?,6,"I don't know why it matters to me, as long as I get out.

&#x200B;

I've been making plans to leave.  Some plans haven't unfolded the way I intended, but I'm still forging ahead.  I'm tired.  It is unbelievably draining to deal with someone who's mood will change instantly over the smallest thing and it can escalate to shouting so much there is spit flying from their mouth, breaking things around the house, and/or physical abuse.  Saying ""you're a dumb bitch"" over something as small as how the pillows were stacked on the bed.  One day it won't matter and one day something small like that matters the most.  And he'll go on a mini rant of how I complain about how he talks to me and that it doesn't matter, just focus on the why and the point of what he is talking about.  It puts you on edge and gives you anxiety on how to treat EVERY little thing you do around this person.  And within a few minutes that same person will call you cute pet names and say they love you and want to hug you and kiss you.  It is confusing and tiring and I'm so over it.  They change up is awful.  Because it CAN be nice at times. And it reminds you of the beginning before they showed their true colors.

&#x200B;

I've stayed because I genuinely care and was foolishly optimistic that he would improve and be better.  Because that's what he kept telling me at first.  They he was changing, and he wanted me to help him grow.  Then it turned into ""it won't be like that if you know how to act"".  But it shouldn't matter how I act, he shouldn't REACT like that.

&#x200B;

Anyways, long story not short and to my point - knowing I'm on my way out, I try my best to act the ""same"".  Like everything is fine, and I feel so submissive and a stranger to myself.  He bosses me around in the oddest was lately, as if to test me on how far he can push me.  I say ""I love you"" and it sounds like a weird echo in my head.  He constantly needs to hear it.  but it is hollow sounding, almost robotic, because even though I care about him, I don't feel the warmth I once did behind those words.  I am resentful but not vindictive.  I struggle to not lash back out at him when he talks to me so disrespectfully just because he's annoyed.  I keep telling myself to focus and just keep at it because I will be out soon.  It feels so wrong to be so fake, but it feels necessary.  Have any of you had to endure this?  or did you not bother to pretend.

&#x200B;

Also I have been battling with preparing a goodbye letter.  Why even bother, right?  Parts of me want to explain myself, and point out everything bad he did to me, or at least the main points of why I'm not doing it anymore.  But is it a waste of time?  Will it even matter to him?   I feel like abusers are always fake sorry.  Or if it's not fake, the sorry is so temporary.  And in their own minds they convince themselves that none of it is their fault. So what would the point be of writing a letter he wouldn't care to understand.  Is the letter really just for me to feel closure?

Not sure,4,"I never thought to post in this subreddit and I definitely have not gone through the horrible experience and pain what everyone else has gone through. I always thought domestic violence was being hit or pushed really hard? My ex was emotionally manipulative but I keep replaying some fights. He has thrown my leftovers down the stairs, my luggage and things out the door one time after I said we should end this.  He has grabbed my foot and tugged it towards the edge of the mattress to grab my wrists and pick me up and locked me outside the room after kicking me out and me refusing to leave. He then opened the door and sort of fake charged at me after I was pounding on the door to at least le me get my things. He has pushed me back after I tried to shove past him blocking my entrance. He has said terrible names and things during arguments.  I in turn have called him an asshole and once slapped his hand when he tried to cuddle with me after being really mean and I told him to please get off. He broke up with me coldly about a month ago. He had been cheating/ broken up with me for someone else. After a month of silence, he told me he loved me on valentines day and ghosted me. I'm just preparing myself if he ever comes back.

""Look, I thought all those things, I questioned why victims did not move on, but when my friend wrote out what the abuser was saying to her, instead of supporting her, I hit her myself with comments about what he said, supporting his lies and hurting her more! I actually fell for his lies myself! It was far, far more complicated than I ever realized. I realized then and there that it takes a lot of work to figure out the lies and find the truth when someone is just trying to get through the day, trying to do the best they can and stay true to a marriage because they take their vows seriously, and I can only try to fathom how heart breaking it must be to try to face the reality of someone who is more subtly abusive. Look, I fell for his lies myself, so I get that it's subtle, but I also love my friend dearly and am here to support her. Not slam her Dr Phil style, but actually support her because I know if I had to get out of a house quickly, like a refugee, that's not an easy thing to do. Logistically, she's got to work at her job, and somehow show up there on time, and living in a high cost of living area, that's seriously threatening to her overall safety from strangers let alone from her spouse.

Free,11,"Tonight I left.

  I was going to do it Friday. Everything was prepared, my friend had left me her house key before leaving on vacation.  He was going to leave to visit his mother.  Usually he'd take the key, so I couldn't leave the house.  He'd order my meals, keep the camera on so he could watch, and call every hour.  He was so angry tonight, and he hurt my cat. I was prepared to take it for another week, I know how to turn off. But I love her, I guess more than I even love myself.  It's been 4 long years.

I wouldn't drink with him. My stomach was in knots, and I begged. He told me if I didn't drink then he knew we would fight, and I was already ruining the night. I always ruin nights, I never know how to agree. Then in a spiral of escalating yelling, banging our pots, then hitting walls, then hitting me. My cat, who I was just reunited with (I had fostered her, gave her to an adopter, then took her back when her adopted got sick) came running up to me as I cried on the kitchen floor and he took her and kicked her as hard as he could. I'm still shaking thinking about her yelp. He took the keys, he left the house -he couldn't be around me anymore. I packed what I could carry, i packed my cat, I left. She didn't ask for this, and I've saved her once before .

I somehow lost my wallet in the mix of it all, I lost almost all my belongings. I have 4 bucks to my name. But I feel so free. My heart is fluttering, my hands are shaking. I don't know whether to cry or scream or laugh. I stayed for so long because I was afraid to have nothing, when nothing can be everything when it's not riddled with fear.

Surviving Thanksgiving and planning my exit.,10,"I’ve posted on this anonymous account multiple times, and deleted most of the posts out of fear.

But today I’m trying to stay calm and disengaged as I continue to plan my exit from this abusive marriage.

Two years ago today he sexually assaulted me - adding PTSD on top of my already present PTSD from sexual assaults as a young woman. That’s my worst memory, but kicking, grabbing, pulling are not far behind. 

After a year of individual then couples therapy I thought he had overcome this need for control. But like clockwork, I’ve been blindsided again into violent, intimidating and psychological abuse. When he starts the crazy-making I literally become dizzy with confusion. 

Thankfully now I’m back in my therapists chair. Thankfully my parents are aware and are prepared to House me when the time comes.
Thankfully I have 3 close friends who support me no matter what.

Despite all of this, I feel constantly sick to my stomach worried about my husband. Worried he will hurt himself when I leave. My anger is deafening, but there is still a small tenderness in my heart for him and not wanting him to hurt. 

Now I just need to work up the courage. Continue to plan. I’ve got an emergency bag ready if he gets violent again - and this time I won’t leave my precious kitty here with him. I’m thinking the next step is speaking with a DV/divorce lawyer. 

I’m a ball of nerves, but I’m clinging to hope that life can be better than marginal and afraid. ",Preparing To Leave

Monday evening: 

Dad’s message on Monday evening before coming home around 11:00pm:

Felt humiliated by whatever happened today morning. I am a man who lives for his self respect, the day that is comprised, is the worst day in my life. This humiliation has been happening repeatedly to me, today’s was the height of it with the entire building being privy to it. I don’t have face anymore to live there & therefore I don’t have a choice but to move into a hostel at the earliest. 

The more I think, I realise I am all alone, there is no one who is mine. Often I am the cause for all your problems, your limitations, your bad past experiences & i have become the favourite punching bag for all the ills at home. So it is only good that I move out, so that you all can start a new life of your choice at least from now onwards & I also will not have the regret of being your bad luck, that I was till date.

Tuesday:

-Screamed at mum for asking him to eat food she prepared and is constantly shoving her away, told her the food she cooks is poison and he doesn’t want to eat the food she prepares anymore.
-Blackmailed mum by telling her that he’s consuming a lot of sweets while at the office (he’s a diabetic patient)
-And threatened that he will come home drunk every night hereafter.
and then left early to office.
-Came home by 9pm
-Refused to eat dinner my mum prepared 

Wednesday:

-Went to office is a little late, because he had to clean the idols, 
-Refused to eat anything, my mum was pleading with him to eat (again because he’s a sugar patient)
-started screaming again.
-Accused me and mum to be ‘shamelessly’ living off ‘his’ money 
-and then told my mum if she forces him to eat food then he will not come home in the evening.
-Came home by 9
-Refused to eat dinner my mum prepared.

Thursday: 
he leaves home extremely early on Thursdays for his business meetings, and he eats there.
Came home around 9.
Hasn’t spoken a word, but can sense that he is extremely angry.
 

All this while my mum is crying, panicking/anxious, concerned for my father. 

My mum is also experiencing memory lapses.

I’m trying to keep my head levelled (even though internally I’m boiling with fumes against such injustice my mum is experiencing) so I can mentally support my mum and listen to everything she has to vent.

Reinventing Myself,3,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post so moderators just let me know.

It’s been a year since any physical violence has happened, but there’s been lots of controlling and manipulating behaviors. He wants a divorce and is waiting for his dream job to happen and we are most likely heading towards divorce. He’s giving us both time to get ourselves prepared. 

We’ve been married 4.5 years,  together for almost 7 years and he didn’t want me working. The two jobs I did have during this time he made it impossible for me to safely be there. I wound up quitting because I didn’t want to put any of my coworkers in danger. 

Anyway...now after 7 years I have an employment gap. I’m not sure how to answer questions about why? I can’t say my husband isolated me and beat me when I made him angry. 

Also, the last solid job I had was a 10 year period of managing a business my boyfriend at the time owned. He passed away and there is no one to put down as a reference. I didn’t keep in contact with anyone from my former life. Not our staff or business associates. I now live in another state all together. 

I made a lot of stupid decisions so no one need point that out.

How in the world at 52 years old do I market myself? I don’t have a college degree - which my husband has offered his military benefits so I could get a degree but that means we’d have to postpone our divorce by 2-4 years. I don’t think he thought that offer through.

Do I have the worst father of all time?,2," In the 26 years of my life I've heard my father scream emptily threatening: ""I will commit suicide"" or ""I will give you a divorce"" so much at my mum, that today when he finally screamed the same old things at her, I said ""lets go to the police and court"" to which he said: ""no! why will we go to the court? lets just live separately instead"". When I continued stressing about going to the court, he angrily stormed off the house with another of his old threats saying ""I will leave this house"". I followed him, just like I've been doing the last couple of times and he went and sat angrily in a park for the next 3 hours while I waited patiently outside, I did not speak a word with him thru this whole ordeal. after which he came back home and rejected having lunch my mum prepared and went off to the office.that was 10 'o'clock in the morning. I had to skip office today because I was mentally paralyzed and had to curl up in bed sleep the entire day.

  
My father, initially when I was a kid, was both physically and mentally abusive to us, though with time he quit abusing physically but his mental torture became worse. he forced my mum to shut the business she was running and economically strangled her when I was in 4th grade. He cut her ties off both with her family and friends circles and isolated her, He has said and continues to this day say horrendous things to and about her which are completely false and cause irreversible psychological damage to her (extremely low-self esteem, self pity and loathing) 

  
my childhood memories with him include (to quote a few):

1. Him taking us all to a lake in our city to jump into and commit suicide one late evening  
2. Him hitting me with a belt one day after coming home from office.
3. Him throwing plates with food around the house that my mum cooked and served him.
4. My mum either being extremely anxious or crying because of him.
5. His earth-shatteringly loud shouting.

Also recently in the last one year, after researching his behavioral patterns, I figured out that he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) the extreme of its kind.that did help us a bit to understand him and tolerate him better thanks to all the articles and YouTube videos available online. me and my mum sat down and discussed strategies and solutions to bear with his behavior without in anyway aggravating it. but at least once every month (at least!) he triggers my mum to a point where she just can't keep quiet anymore and then uses that opportunity to belittle her further and further and make her feel like a piece of trash.

  
I come from an Indian family and live in an extremely conservative society. My mum has, ever since her marriage, been conditioned to fear the society's judgement and insults that will come with divorce. Initially when I was just a baby and she wanted to quit her marriage, she approached her own father who asked her to shut her mouth and learn to deal with it.she is absolutely terrified of divorce and cannot imagine a life like that and would much rather prefer living in this hell day-in and day-out because a known devil is better than an unknown devil.

  
I am a 'man' who has just entered his late 20's, but I don't feel man enough, I feel like a child and I find myself behaving like one too. All of my childhood has been extremely depressing with a lot of issues, I was sexually abused as a kid by a family member, bullied in school and failed most of my subjects. And whenever I'm around my father I'm mentally crippled by anxiety. I have stopped speaking with him for the past two years now even though we live in the same house, which he blames my mum every other day for apparently brainwashing us against him.

  
He gives my mum money that's less than enough to run the house comfortably, even though he earns pretty well, and then she has to beg him for more money, at which point he starts abusing her even more and throws the money at her condescendingly. Even though I am slowly becoming financially independent, there is still quite some time before I become absolutely independent, but that doesn't seem to help my case because I cant move out if my mum won't. and even if I did, I'd have to constantly live in the fear of him physically or mentally abusing her with more freedom than ever, with no one around to protect her.

  
since evening mum and I were extremely anxious of what his next revenge strategy would be, there are no signs of him coming home which from his pattern we understand is also a part of his strategy to make us call him, profusely apologize to him and then beg him to come home. ",Preparing To Leave
my domestic violence story + where I'm at now.,1,"*trigger warning: descriptions of severe mental abuse, and physical abuse, advise not to read if you're sensitive to domestic violence descriptions.**

(this post is way too long, and this doesnt even begin to touch on the details. I just needed a place to write down how I feel and what I experienced from my abuser.) 

being in a healthy, happy relationship after a severely abusive one is the strangest yet most comforting feeling in the world. I went from being afraid of an abuser to only feeling truly safe in the arms of someone who loves me and wants to protect me. I am so lucky.

it's just... weird though. like the concept of someone who just wants to love me, and build a happy life with me, seems SO SURREAL yet somehow I know I found the one. it's so easy to second guess yourself, though. I thought I found the one before and it ended up being the biggest and most traumatizing mistake of my life.

there's nothing like this feeling, truly. 
he can tell just by looking in my eyes when my PTSD is triggered. sometimes he realizes it before i even do. I don't even have to explain, he is so caring that he can sense it. sometimes its from an arm coming too close to my face, which immediately triggers my fight or flight reflexes. sometimes nothing happens yet for some reason my brain decides to try to protect itself from danger. he can see it from across a room,  and will drop everything to reassure me with kind, loving words. ""babe, look at me. you're safe now, okay? nobody is ever going to hurt you again. I will do everything in my power to protect you. you're strong, and I'm here to help you when you have a hard time finding your strength. please remember, our relationship is one you will always feel safe in. we are safe in eachothers arms. you're safe now, never forget it."" and I'm just shocked. how did he recognize that I desperately needed to hear those words? I didn't even know I needed to hear those words. I never thought anyone would be so in tune with my body language and my energy to be able to know what I need before I do. yet every time he reassures me, I feel a weight lift off of me. he is making me feel better and I didn't even know I needed anything like that from him.

there is certain moments in your life that you will never, ever forget. this healthy relationship post abuse is such a monumental moment for me. I was convinced by an abuser that I was genuinely unlovable. by the time I found that last bit of courage I had to leave, only fueled by this genuine need to survive. if I would have stayed, this time I would have died. I didn't want to die like this. I wasn't even a person anymore. I was a shell of a scared, little girl. I was once so innocent, now any sense of innocence has been completely taken away from me and violated in every way possible. nobody in this world could've ever convinced me that I was safe. everyone was a threat because abusers wait until you're deeply in love with them before they gradually, very slowly but very carefully, destroy every single piece of your self esteem. they destroy you until you are nothing on your own. until you have no choice but to need them because they took everything else away from you. after experiencing narcissistic abuse, it's fucking hard to ""see the good"" in people because they're usually REALLY GOOD at not showing you the real, bad side of them. it's hard not to assume that you will find yourself drowning again. which means it's a lot easier to avoid giving your heart to someone. nobody can destroy me if I don't let them near me. it's safer that way, right? it could be good, but the small chance that abuse happens again isn't worth it. I can't imagine going through that trauma again. 

how does one move forward when you've given yourself, given all of your love, given every piece of your dignity, to some sick messed up version of love that you've been manipulated to believe is normal.

I genuinely never thought I would trust someone again. until I met him. before my current significant other, I have been in ONE real long term relationship, it took every piece of me to take a leap of faith, I already had trust issues from an absent father. and this one relationship was ugly in every sense of the word. I knew young that I would never let a man define my worth. and still, I gave all of my trust to someone who showed me nothing but hatred and darkness. I believed then that I was making the right decision. I never would have imagined, that this person I had grown to love, would one day be known to me only as my ""abuser."" and nothing more. I knew it would take someone special for me to completely give my heart to them. and I FUCKED UP. bad. I fucked up and gave all of the trust I had in me to someone who would never be capable of loving me. the darkness will show itself eventually, but the damage will already be done.

I was so careful, so meticulous, so picky, and so protective of myself for so long. I told myself it would take someone truly magical to convince me that I would be happier in a relationship than by myself, and this was before experiencing any sort of domestic violence. I shield myself because I have always had a big heart, and am essily taken advantage of. independence is so important to me, I've never been one to depend on anyone or anything. at the end of every single day, I'M the only person who has my back. so I promised myself I would be careful and be safe and guarded. I did everything you're supposed to do. and I still managed to find myself in the depths of hell, dancing with a devil. intimacy, trust, communication, loyalty, are all so deeply meaningful to me. I have never slept with a person without feeling confident that I love them. to me, the beauty of intimacy comes with an emotional connection. I've never strayed from that, even now.

it took me months of mental debate to come to the realization: I am going to choose him. tons of crumpled up pros and cons list, confiding in my bestfriend that I think I finally found someone who will take care of my heart. The first male partner I would give myself too. I was already damaged. it took me months for me to even decide if I wanted to pursue this any further. I let my mom know that I have feelings for someone. I'm an adult, and I still felt like I needed to know that it was okay for me to open my heart to the possibility of love. I never thought I was about to go through the hardest 3 years of my life.

so young. so naive. but so overwhelmed by the thought of even letting him know I was interested in him. I felt so vulnerable and exposed. I was giving him an entrance into my heart, and I can't afford it to cause me anymore pain. just the mere thought of asking him out for dinner took me weeks to do.

it's time. I'm 18 years old. a whole life ahead of me. if this doesn't work out, I'll be okay. I am hurting so much from past trauma, but if this doesn't go well I have family and friends who love me and will help me through it. reassuring myself that I was genuinely ready to take this next step.

I went for it. I was shocked at how uninterested he seemed. did I really just spend nearly a year gathering this courage for someone who isn't even interested?

time moved so slowly, but I could tell I was falling for him. he was young, so was I, but I could tell that whatever I was feeling was the start of a beautiful love story. he was interested in me too, and that was the end of my innocence as I knew it.

he was great. he told me everything I wanted to hear. I'm beautiful, I'm worth it, my pain doesn't define me. every word felt so eloquent, and it felt like the things he was saying were coming out of my own mouth. it was like.... he knew everything about me without even trying. later I realized he knew what to to say to make me fall in love with him. 

after only a year together, the vibe was the complete opposite. not only was I confused, but he love bombed me so hard into oblivion that I lost sight of everything besides him. he loved me and treated me so well at first, 6 months of making memories and genuinely falling in love with this person who in perceived to be the one I was waiting for. zero red flags. zero bad days. everything else disappeared when I was with him.

suddenly, here I am, 6 months later, without a job. he said that we would never get to see each other if I spent half my life ""sucking uncle Sam's dick"" for a paycheck. he wasn't wrong. we would barely get the see eachother. in reality, he was gearing up to make sure I never needed another person besides him. I didn't even notice we were spending too much time together until I realized I hadn't seen my mom in a month and she lived less than a mile away. it's okay, I'm just in love for the first time, and on my own for the first time. I'll go pay her a visit tonight.

he asks me if she has even tried to check up on me. I think about it, and I realize she has barely even spoken to me. what I didn't realize is he was putting false ideation of my mother not caring about me into my head. come on brain, stop letting him in, my mom loves me more than grass loves water. I am her everything. this behavior continued to deteriorate all of my relationships with loved ones. they weren't him, and he couldn't let anyone get in his way. isolation will leave me alone and unable to see the truth.

slowly, but surely, he somehow managed to convince me that my mother couldn't care less if i was around or not. years later I would find out she was battling a bout of severe depression. and I was the one who wasn't speaking to her. I'm hurt.

after its over, after you decide to leave and never look back, this is when you truly realize that you have been being controlled and brainwashed since the very first day. every single thing that has happened over the timespan of your relationship was an attempt to gain a *little* more control of you slowly, and with every push and pull, you lost a bit of what makes you, you. every time he takes control from you, the less you feel the need to fight because you're slowly losing your self-respect and love for yourself.

mental abuse, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, narcissistic abuse, and physical abuse. they all go hand in hand. how does an abuser even keep track of what's left and what's right? they're obviously deeply damaged, but they play their own game better than you. the facade they project onto others is alarmingly convincing, terrifying even. you slowly come to realize that you're not dealing with a human, the person in front of you is a monster. but don't get too excited, he won't let anyone else see what you see.

it's hard to truly understand or grasp what you're feeling when you come to these realizations. time after time they're continuing to prove that you that they will never change, but yet you're being sucked in deeper and deeper. 

then you wake up, that first second in the morning when you're just entering another day, stretching, hearing the birds chirp, God it's beautiful. the moment in time before reality hits you. your stomach drops, it wasn't just a nightmare. you are truly in living hell. be careful where you walk, every other step you're going to get burned. you'll spend every waking second trying so hard to please someone who only finds pleasure in torturing you down to your core. you're defenseless.

I feel like the hardest concept to reflect after its over is all of the excuses I made. I made wild excuses for someone who didn't deserve them. I always managed to come up with a justification or a reason for the abuse. if you find yourself in this headspace, you may even begin to believe the stuff you're pulling out of nowhere, there has to be a reason, and there has to be a way I can make it better. more than likely you will start to develop unhealthy ways to cope with the abuse that's being served to you on a silver platter. youll find yourself more focused on the shiny plate rather than the gross moldy food on top of it. i found it easiest to take it out on myself because I was convinced that I was the problem.

looking back, I did everything right. I did more than I should have. there wasn't a thing I wouldn't do for him... I loved him. I needed him. I didn't pay important bills because he needed the money more than I did, for drugs lr whatever was more important to him than the bills. he belittled me and bullied me to hand over the money until i had no choice but to give up and give in. once and done, now he knows my finances are his, theyll never be mine again. you try to defend yourself, but it will never work. you can't reason with the devil. but they sure enjoy watching you try.

you'll beg. you'll plead. at this point you will do anything to see that they know you are in there. you'll cry, you'll hurt, I couldn't manage words at this point because 24/7 my brain was in fight or flight mode. you will wake up every day never knowing what battle you'll be fighting today. no matter what it is, I'll say it again: you will never, ever win a battle against this monster. at least I never did.

it's been 2 years together now, a lifetime has passed. wow is your life different. there is no such thing as one good day anymore. nothing is the same. your friends are over hearing you always ask for help, you're still trying to make things work even though they told you he is toxic. you love him. your family is begging for you to realize and recognize that you have let a monster ruin your life. I'm hopeless.

at least for me, this is when I started to change my mind. I loved him, I tried, every day, not only did I give him my heart, I gave him my sanity. as long as I'm here with him, I will never be myself again.

after its over, you'll overlook this part of the story many times. you knew that you didn't stand a chance against the abuse and if you would have just left like you wanted too, you would have saved yourself so much pain. you didn't leave though. you are losing yourself.

it felt like all of the pain and heartache I had before I met my abuser was a cake walk. I was hurting, but I was managing to get through it. I would have done anything to go back to the previous pain and trauma. but this, this is how you lose your sanity. 2 years went by, and he has finally managed to convince me through manipulation that every single thing that has happened up to this point was simply my fault. he said I was crazy, I defended myself over and over again until it felt like the words I was saying were empty. I no longer believed that I was innocent. it has to be my fault. I'm guilty.

he managed to actually turn me into the crazy person he pretended I was this entire time. once so innocent, but now I am frantic and uncontrollable. I have succumbed to his control. the ball is in his court, and I'm prepared to do anything it takes to satisfy his need for destruction. I never once got a simply I'm sorry, or any sort of remorse, yet I spent half of every day apologizing to him for things that made no sense. just apologize and oblige to his orders. anything else will only fuel the fire. I'm over it.

I hurt myself. if I would start to cry, the tears would keep flowing until I passed out from exhaustion. I couldn't shut my brain off, all of the confusion and stress made me want to explode. I've started to punch myself and slap myself because it just never ended. I couldn't run anywhere. everyone tried to tell me to run as fast as I could, but he's MY abuser, not yours. I'm still trying to salvage this. I love him. I'm mentally destroyed, I am no longer sane.

at least now I don't feel the need to fight back. I just oblige. the name calling never ended, but suddenly I became used to being tore down. I never thought I would ever get used to being called worthless and stupid on a daily basis. at first each name hurt like a stab wound, but he's right, every name he calls me feels right now. they all fit, now he has managed to convince me that I AM worthless and I AM stupid. every day the names echoed in my head. he's inside my head now. I love him. he's destroying me.

I always wonder where that last bit of courage to run came from. I never even tried to leave before this. I was afraid. he has now threatened every member of my family, never without that devilish grin. he's put his hands around my throat a couple times, squeezing just tight enough to imply that he could end my life, easier than I ever thought was possible. I would dream that I could go back in time and erase him from my life. 1000 days, wasted away, and now I'm left here, empty and yearning for the last 3 years to erase from my memory.

he didn't often physically abuse me. I never once was hit, slapped, kicked, or punched. the times he has physically assaulted me, he never hesitated to go right for my neck with his hands and spit on my face. we don't need to waste time here, I knew that those hands were there to end my life. one time he pushed me down the stairs, but you know.... I slipped, right? God, I'm clumsy.

a few times I tried to rack my brain, is there any reason to choke someone besides with intent to kill? I was curious, but all I could find on Google was that in a mere 10 seconds, he could send me into an inconscious bliss. that was enough for me to put my phone down. any time I have ever thought about abuse in relationships the first thing that comes to my mind is slapping them or hitting them in a fit of rage. how angry does one have to be to look into someone's eyes, smile and not even hesitate to strangle them? I'm scared now.

I put on my own facade, telling everyone things are getting so much better and he has finally changed his ways, when things were just getting worse. maybe if i pretend things are improving, they actually will get better. am I losing hope?

I've now seen what it looks like the stare into the eyes of an emotionless psychopath. I am no longer here for my own need to fix him, and fix us, I'm here because I'm so exhausted that I can barely even think straight and my exhaustion makes me weak and scared. I would still get up and go to work every day, and it was so hard to pretend like my life was full of rainbows and butterflies. it baffled my mind that when I came to work with a black eye from him slamming a door on my face, not a single soul questioned it. I didn't even need to come up with an excuse, nobody asked. I know that my eyes screamed for help. I didn't even think that leaving was an option now. I'm just so scared. 

he has rendered me completely unable to function properly. my strength to stay focused at work was diminishing every day. I was no longer myself. I would sleep and wouldn't even be phased or care when my boss would scold me for sleeping on the clock. it didn't matter. there was nothing left inside of me to care. the last hour on the job I spent sobbing at the thought of what waited for me at home. this continued every day for months. I'm broken, and bruised.

we are nearing 3 years of constant abuse now. I didn't even have the energy to talk anymore. I just wanted to never wake up. if I tried to sleep he would scream or play loud music to keep me awake. he slept while I was at work just to make sure he had enough energy to prevent me from sleeping. weeks of no sleep. I am now passing out at work without even trying. I am sneaking into the bathroom to take 3 hour long naps. I never thought the floor of a dirty bathroom stall would feel so peaceful and more comforting than my bed. I don't think I even want to live anymore.

I don't love him. I just don't. when I look at him I get sick to my stomach. nobody else saw what I saw. he was charming and funny, and he makes comments in front of friends about how his girlfriend is a space case. there i am, in the corner of the room, legs up to my chest and unable to speak without crying. I do look like a space case, but I havent slept much in days and I am being mentally abused daily. people expressed their concern for him, worried that I was psychotic and ruining his life. I had no will left in me. please don't kiss me, I don't love you anymore, the thought of him touching me made me wince. he violated me. he took advantage of me. he coerced me to sleep with him. I would cry during, and it didn't phase him a bit. one time after sex I looked at him, and I told him I didn't recognize him anymore. he laughed. I'm fucking done for.

he continued to belittle and bully me. I am 100% unreactive and unresponsive every time. I wanted to scream out loud that he did this to me, but I need to save this tiny ounce of energy just in case he tries to hurt me again. then he said the words I will never forget.

""you're not the woman I fell in love with anymore.  you have changed and I just want my brooklyn back.""

those words started the beginning of the end. it was a giant blur. I just know I would try to run outside and he would chase me and pull me back inside. I made it out the door once, the fresh air felt freeing. he tackled me down to the ground. I was praying that since we were outside, someone would see what was happening and help me. I'm being abused. please help me. he was destroying my belongings, and the threats were getting more frequent.

I could scream at the top of my lungs and nobody would hear me. the only person who can save me is myself. I told him I needed a break from him, running and getting in my mom's car and breaking down. this is it. after I admit to what was happening to me, there is no taking it back. am I truly ready to let go of everything I know and start over? my mom was so confused, she knew our relationship was rocky but she had no idea how truly dark my life was. she cried with me. she was scared. I was scared. I was broken.

a week of going back and forth between him and my family, he would drag me back just to send me running again. my mom begged me to stay in her arms. I knew that one of these days it was going to be the last time. I will keep running until he disappears for good. until I'm free. he would beg and plead for me to come home. say he is sorry he broke me and that he would do whatever it took to fix things. I would come home for a few hours or an evening, just to suffer the same abuse as always. the last week before my final escape, he destroyed my phone because I wouldn't answer his calls. i cant contact the outside world in anyway, now. he poured ice cold water on me while I was asleep. he told me that I make him want to kill himself. and that his heroin addiction was all my fault. he posted Facebook statuses saying ""brooklyn won't be happy unless I die"". posted pictures with a knife to his throat. I tried to make sure he didn't hurt himself. I don't want his death on my hands. I care about everyone enough to help.

he never intended to kill himself. he just needed me to come running back to save him. the final night, the last time I saw him face to face, we both ended up arrested. a noise complaint turned into a police officer seeing marijuana in the apartment. he says that my abuser needs a 72 HR hold for suicidal threats and he would be getting a mental evaluation at the jail. I felt so much relief, this is my chance. I can pack all of my stuff and leave. I decide that I am going to tell the cops that I'm being abused. its easy to see, my body is covered in bruises from trying to run and him grabbing me. I'm beaten.

I am telling them as much as I can. I am sobbing. I am sharing this information and this is it. I can't go back after this. they listen, they comfort me, they're in disbelief. he seems so nice and charming.. that's what everyone says. they reassure me that I am safe to leave, he will be spending the next few days under medical evaluation for threats of suicide. I'm free to go. the cop offers me a lift, I say yes. I feel so much relief. it's done. I ask if it's safe for me to head to my apartment, I just need to grab my cats and then I'll call my mom for a ride and leave my abuser to be with the people who truly love me, my parents. 

the cop and I say our farewells. I feel so much relief, but that's a fleeting feeling. the relief soon turns to betrayal which soon turns to fear. he's here. and I FUCKED UP. he knows that I told the cops everything, and the look in his eyes could kill. did his charming charisma fool the cops too? his demeanor is menacingly calm, and as we stand there facing eachother, a second feels like eternity. I am completely helpless. I still don't want to die. not by his hands. I just want to sleep. I have to work tomorrow. but the look he's giving me let's me know he isn't going down without a fight. I try my hardest to stay calm. it's working. I am slowly walking towards my bedroom. if I can make it in there, I am sure if I lock the door behind me I can safely escape out the window. it's that or he will kill me. it was eerily quiet, and as soon as I locked the door I knew I wasn't going to have time to escape. I looked down and saw he had broken the door before I arrived, he must've kicked it out of anger. the door is hanging by a thread. I know what is about to happen. my heart is racing. I'm terrified.

before I even had a chance to think, I go falling backwards. he threw himself into the door and now I'm more afraid than I ever have been. by some leap of faith, after fading in and out of consciousness, I broke free. he grabbed me a few times, leaving bruises of handprints on my arm that would stay for weeks to come. I hadn't even realized that he had strangled me, the bruises on my neck clearly outlining his hand print. my fall nearly knocked me out. I am halfway there. this is it. I never want to see his face again. I run. I run and I don't stop running. I know he's behind me, but my screams for help send him retreating back inside. I remember he was laughing. I'm destroyed.

the run to my mom's house was trauma filled. I never stopped running until I was safely inside. I didn't even look back. I was afraid of what I would see, and perhaps also afraid of what I wouldn't see. my future is void. what life is waiting for me? I have no friends and I have alot of relationships to attempt to mend. suddenly I felt an overwhelming feeling of fear. I am physically safe now, but I know my battle has barely begun. 

I didn't do much of anything for a couple days. I didn't want to talk about it. I locked myself in my room. he was going to come after me, I knew it. I made my step dad keep a gun ready to go next to his bed. I was petrified that he would come finish the job. 

the only thing worse than the abuse is trying to understand and rationalize it afterwards. what does this mean for me now?

6 months have passed, and it feels like I'm living a completely different life. I am now living my life on my own terms. I no longer let the abuse define me. I am trying to make sure I talk about it as much as I can. you never know who might need to hear it. whether you're a victim of abuse, or have witnessed it first hand, share your story. advocate for fallen victims and survivors. every day I heal a little more. every day it feels less like pain and more like strength. I survived a situation I thought for sure was going to kill me. I'm a survivor. sharing my story has helped me to heal tremendously. 

my abuser was a mere 19 years old. barely even old enough to vote, but he was charming and conniving. alot of our mutual friends still hang out with him, which left me with nobody to trust. I haven't seen him since that day, and I hope I never have to see him again. I was failed by my local police department. I was too trusting and they failed to protect me. I made it very clear to them that I was scared he was going to hurt me.

if you managed to make it to the end of this, thank you from the bottom of my heart. abuse can come in many shapes and forms. if you ever find yourself in my shoes, please leave at the first warning signs. you can never be too cautious, I learned that the hard way.

right now, I'm discovering new things to learn about myself every day. at first, I had no interest in sharing my story with anyone. it's my pain to carry, and I would never want anyone to pity me. when you share your trauma, you are making yourself vulnerable. it is hard to tell who really cares and who just feels bad for you. I developed some unhealthy coping mechanisms while still in the abusive relationship, which followed me afterwards. I am no longer innocent.

now, I'm reminded every single day that I am finally safe. I'm not running from the boy I begged to love me, I'm running into the arms of a man who respects me. after being convinced I am unlovable, I found someone who never quits showing me every day just how much I am loved. he didn't fix me, but he offered me his hand and hasn't given up no matter how hard I pull away. his patience with me is graceful, his kind heart makes me feel at home. not once has he been unkind, he sees my soul every day and continues to prove to me that he is my protector. I didn't have to give him my heart, I just gave him my hand and without any words he shows me that I can move mountains. all it takes is a glance into his eyes for the weight of my pain to lift off of my shoulders. he didn't save me, but he keeps me grounded. it is so strange to open up to someone after being abused, but maybe I needed to go through the biggest mistake of my life to find the biggest blessing in my life. I'm not longer drowning, I'm riding the waves of trust. I truly don't know what the future holds for me, but I think a peaceful and happy life is waiting for me. 

I truly am grateful to be alive today. I made it out, and I am so much stronger now. I put my crown on and smiled like a boss. 4 years ago, i never would have thought that someone as cautious as me could find themselves being abused. I wish you all lots of love and happiness.",Preparing To Leave
Kicked out of the house (and threatened to leak my photos),9,"Hi everyone,

I was in a relationship with someone 33 years senior to me. It didn't bother me and definitely didn't bother him either. After 2 month, I moved in with him which was a poor choice now that I think about it. I should have tried to know him more but he insisted that he is old and he does not have the luxury for it.

We had issues when I lived with him as he is OCD about everything but I got adapted to it. I got adapted to all the things I didn't like about him, like talking about someone's back, especially neighbors, complaining and more. I thought it was just me and that it will get better.

So over the span of our relationship, he fought with me relentlessly and has so far kicked me out of ""HIS"" house 3-4 times. I do not know what came over me all when he would come to his senses and apologize and cry that we just need to relate and talk to stop pushing each other away. The third time he tried kicking me out was in a Hotel in Vancouver while I was on the call and thats when it started, he started hitting me. I told him off right there and then that he cannot hit me or ill call the cops. He hit me again and I had to dial the number. He kept at it saying cut the call and I let it ring and so I ran across the room close to the door to the hallway and I told them that I'm being assaulted and right then he is telling me thats it get out of the hotel room. I do not know what came over me but in respect of our relationship I cut the call and I switched the phone off and sat in the corner by the door and told him to back off. After him persistently bugging me I had to leave the room to walk outside the hotel around the parking lot for 3-4 hrs. I came in and tried sleeping on the sofa on the hallway, and when I saw his messages after switching my phone on, I decided to go back to the room where he opened the door and I went back to him (worst thing I could do).

Now not even 6 hours ago I got kicked out one last time. He didn't talk to me properly all afternoon and evening yesterday and same today he is not talking to me facing his computer and then he had his tantrums where he would go upstairs while I'm downstairs. He came down after a while (which he was preparing for something) and started screaming at me ""What do you think I'm doing right now? This has to STOP and you will get a nasty letter tomorrow."" He always had financial issues even after I contributed as much as I could but he called me saying that that was barely anything close to paying for the house. I who graduated from University just 2 months ago in search for any job but cannot find one in a small town. After saying that he went up.

He came back maybe after 5 min or something and started screaming ""SHUT OFF YOUR COMPUTER, I MADE DINNER COME UP"" and I told him no (I didn't scream at him, but he kept screaming at me). I could not be ordered by a drunk who doesn't know how to speak to someone he says he loves. he rush down and he kept repeating for 2 more time before he grabbed my laptop by the screen and snatching it away from me.

Now last time he hit me, and he's trying to damage a student property that at the moment he cannot afford to pay for. so I smacked him 4-5 times (I should not have done that but being scared and having had enough makes your body react in self defense). He smacked me back and said he will call 911 now that I assaulted him (its as if he was waiting for me to attack). He told them that I am living rent free and he wants me removed from his house (which is false as I stopped paying due to not having a job and cannot ask parents for money since last month). He made up his side of the story and stayed on the call till the cop came. He talked to both of us and advised us that this should stop or someone is going to get arrested. While he was talking to the cop I did something really stupid. I messaged his mom and 2 of our common friends (his friend that became my friend too) what was going on and one of them got back to him and he came back at me saying ""Stop texting people trashing me or it will backfire"" and emailed me later ""I have contacts of your family and will expose you now your choice. Be respectful or suffer the fallout. Not me.""

I told the cop that I am not safe in that house and I will instead go to the neighbors house (apparently the one he hates as the other one had guests and I am close to the former neighbor). I told her everything as I had to talk to someone for a long time but I just kept it in. This was the final straw.

Laster tonight he emailed me threatening me about my things and belongings:

""They will be removed on my terms and at my timing. I own this home and everything in it, that’s the law, so your stuff will be packed by ME and left on the driveway or on Neighbor’s driveway in a couple days. You will never ever enter this house again because you chose not to stay and discuss it or be reasonable. This is MY home not yours and your stuff will be released on my timing and terms not yours. And do NOT bring the Neighbor here to battle for you. As well if you message anyone else as you have been your parents will be advised of everything and remember I have pictures to prove it. Grow up or suffer. I will put your shit on the driveway by Sunday night and that is all. Salud. ""

Now I really do not care about the house, but I have my belongings in that house, which includes my passport and important documents and I am told that I can take this to the police. I am in BC, Canada and I do not think anyone can do something like this and then lock me out of my stuff. Is it allowed? I have the right to go in and grab everything I own. I tried local websites but they do not explain it properly. Only thing I know is I am calling the cops first thing in the morning. Does anyone know what is the best way to go about it? I don't want my stuff to be thrown around and broken as I know he is capable of that.

Thank you

(Sorry about the long post)

<UPDATE>
I woke up after 2 hrs of sleep last night and couldn't stop shaking. I ended up calling the police and asking them for help and they were really helpful. Later in the morning I saw his email after he calmed down. He was heartbroken and felt used and didn't feel appreciated. I can see all that but I had been hiding my depression about unemployment and helplessness and bills piling up (which is almost exactly what he is in). I went over after asking if he's home. It was completely different from before. He was humble, understanding, broken and said that this is what we needed the night before. We talked and talked while I tried to pack my stuff that he piled up.

Worst of all was the fact that I felt numb and he even asked me if I feel anything because he is tearing apart. This is not what I imagine and never my intention and it feels like I have shattered both of ourselves and we dont know what can be done. I have lost hope because I know it will happen again and next time I know it will break me.

When I left after packing and standing over a box for 10 or 30 min doing nothing, I told him I will see him tomorrow. Neighbor (Jane) talked to me and I could feel the numbness going away. So she decided to take me with her to grocery store and on the way all of a sudden I couldn't stop my tears. And I feel helpless. I dont want my bf to be hurt at the same time I feel like the poison or leech locked up in a small town with no room to grow and find opportunities. Somehow the next thing I know we end up going to her friends BBQ party while im dressed like I want to be in bed. I tried making conversations but being the only odd person in the room I dove down into my phone and kept refreshing my email and messages ... hoping someone talks to me. Eventually my stupid phones battery died and I had no choice but to smile at jokes and stare at the TV.

Eventually Jane decided to leave her old neighborhood friends to drop by another friend and their million $ partially renovated house. I felt good being distracted for the moment talking to people and alas had to leave as it was 10.

Alas after finally grocery shopping I started to feel something ... I should do mostly for myself.

I think staying at Jane's place should be no more than tomorrow night and in respect of my bf (as I really loved him and maybe possibly still do) and out of respect for all the things he has done for me, basically driving me to anywhere I wanted to go, cook for me most of the time and more; I think I should go back * NOT * to start over the cycle again, but to bring closure to us as he should be the last person I was with in the city while flying off back to my family.

Now after reading his another email -->

I am sitting here tonight feeling like I am dead inside, I know I fucked up, I know I deserve to be punished, I know I don’t deserve another chance, but how do we go from loving each other and holding you falling asleep on Thursday to no more dinners, no more walks, no more watching TV and the news, no more love whatsoever? How does it just totally stop? You asked me once, if I would stand by you no matter what because you might endure the toughest of times, and I said yes. Why won’t you stand by me and give me a chance in my toughest of times? I am not all bad, you love me yes? Can I not be given a chance to at least try to redeem myself and fix this? I am not perfect but should I be punished for the rest of my life and lose you entirely for it? Am I not worth anything, any chance at forgiveness? 

I cannot go from having you the focus of my life to absolutely nothing it will destroy me, do you not care about that at all? You ask me to realize how you felt with being told to leave, how do you think it feels to be told I’m alone for the rest of my life? Do I deserve to perish for this forever? Do you really believe that? How do I tell the doctor this week that we went from having issues to being entirely cut off from each other? Is this what a guy who loves you deserves? 

Is this my punishment for life? Doesn’t some part of you feel something for me? I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again, doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance? 

Why do I have to be destroyed for this? Would you want me to do this to you? Didn’t you ask me if I would stand by you forever? I’m not going to make it with this loss, I’m literally crumbling and you just don’t care, I’m in shock that even though I’ve been a total jerk and deserve to lose you that some part of you doesn’t feel empathy and love and sorrow and wants to comfort me back? I’m sorry we all make mistakes and lose it, you have, I have, and maybe I’m worse in the mix up but should I suffer for the rest of my life for it? 

I committed to loving you forever, I told you I would marry you, I mean it STILL! Doesn’t some part of you feel anything for me? Do you not concern yourself with what will happen to me or us? How can we go from such love to such absence of it? Was it ever love then? I’m crashing I don’t know how to get over this, I cannot because you mean everything to me. 

Oh God please think. Although I’ve made a ton of mistakes and am not perfect did I not stand by you, support you, and take the best care of you I possibly could? Did I not hold you every night, nurture you every day, accommodate everything I could to please you, even though I screwed up? Doesn’t some part of you feel terrified of losing me too forever? For God’s sake no one deserves this much retribution and punishment. I am not all bad, I know I’m scared and I have faults and I screw up, and I am willing to do the final process of a counsellor to see if it’s fixable, isn’t that what people who love each other do? Isn’t that what marriage vows are? 

Good, bad, sickness, health? How would you feel if I dropped you like this and just cut you off forever. I know I said get out there times but don’t you know by now that I didn’t truly mean it? I know I deserve to suffer for it, but losing you for life? LIFE? Never seeing you again from having you in my arms every night? Is that fair? Is that devotion? Is that called loving your partner? Please I beg of you to think about this. Please do not destroy everything we ever had in one swift move. It will break my heart for the rest of my life. I beg you, I love you, I need you, I cherish you, and I adore you. Please please please. Think about this! I am your family too! Even Rox and Lu will miss you! 

Please please think about the months to come and how we should be together. We belong together. We fell in love yes we have issues, I do, you do, but please don’t send me to hell for the rest of my life. I love you. I need to share my life with you. Please don’t end us and end this love. Please! My heart will die if I lose you! PLEASE! 

---- end of email ----

I dont know at this point what to even do or even ask for anything from anyone. I have planned everything that I need to leave in order to grow as I am not growing. Jane tells me I need to become strong and grow and her advise is for me to leave the city and go back to family and find my self worth.

I feel like I was a paper used up and crumbled and tossed in the garbage. I really love him but I do not know to make him feel better and move on to my family. 

What would you do if you were in my shoes? I feel like I want to scream till I die as it's my fault for finding a happy path for everyone that eventually make everyone unhappy.

I've been subpoenaed and don't know how to prepare - please help. Any advice is appreciated.,6,"Hi r/domesticviolence, I'm hoping you can help. I have been subpoenaed to testify against my husband in 3 weeks and I have no idea what to expect. He was arrested three weeks ago and I've been in a depressed daze since.  I finally tried reaching out to all the DV resources I could find but no one picks up the phone. I can't muster the strength to leave the house right now.

How do I prepare for court? I have no interest in sending him to jail and just wish the whole thing would go away.",Preparing To Leave
"I (22F) far away from home, in a relationship that could be heading to abuse. Know what to do, but not where to find the strength.",9,"This is the first time for me to talk about it  ro someone. I haven't even talked to my sister, who is like my best friend.

We have been together for almost two years.. But I think I don't love him anymore.. I moved in with him in March. I moved there because I thought I loved him, even though I had been afraid of moving in, I didn't know why but now I guess I know.

Our relationship isn't completely bad. It is actually great most of the times. We make each other laugh, he talks to me about everything that happens to him. We always go out together. We used to pet a puppy together. He is caring usually, he majes sure I don't get a cold or something. We do the chores equally. We have mutual friends (well, used to be his friends, but now are mutual since I don't know anybody in his town). He loves cuddling, even more than me. His mom and aunt like me too.

But there have been some dark portions of our relationships, which I am ashed to talk about.

First of all, the lightest part - when he is nervous because of something, he lashes out on me in shape of harsh criticism. Or he yells. 'You always stare at your phone!!!' (when I read stuff there because I am bored), 'You can' t even walk on earth' (if I slip on something), 'You always lose my lighter' (lost it once, he lost it more times), 'you act like a f* child' (for being afraid of thunderstorm). Etc.

But the most frequent criticism and yelling is about my 'share' of house chores. He always complains about the house being dirty all the time (untrue because I clean it all the time), me not doing any chores (and I do a ton of dishes every day, do laundry 2-3 times a week, cook all three meals including his special breakfast and long time to prepare stews as we do not eat fast food, etc). Then he complains about having to do 'most chores' (taking the trash out and going grocery shopping, and vacuuming.. When it is his weekend off).

He grumbles and yells only on his 'nervous' days. Maybe once a week. Sometimes three days in a row. Sometimes it is two weeks of not yelling. 

Anyway today we had an argument. Today I cleaned the whole house completely, and he repeatedly complained and yelled because I had forgotten to wipe a tiny foundation strain off the washing machine and a few crumbles off the table.. And he also complained about dinner (I made some sort of a cheese bread and I didn't add enough flour so it was a little softer than intended), and accused me of 'fu*ing it up because I didn' t feel like making dinner so I made it half-heartedly'. 

I was seriously tired of him repeating same old same old for half an hour so while he was talking, I watching at the TV and saying 'Yea uhmm' (after telling him, unsuccessfuly, not to yell). This made him furious and he got red in rage, punched the table and said 'It will be like I say it will be, you will listen to me'. It was kind of scary. I told him 'Oh yeah? Is it? Cool mate', and then he pushed me forcefully. He didn't hit me, just pushed me really hard. 

I unstantly started crying, he kept yelling, I asked him how dare he push me, he said it was because I made fun of him. He didn't apologize, but he calmed down in 10 minutes or so. 

He started getting cuddly but I am still angry as hell.

I am also weak. I don't know what to do. I hate stuff like this hapoening. Our relationship, minus his nervousness days, is great. I hate it. I have no courage or strength. I am not afraid of him, I am afraid of leaving him and then feeling sorry for him. What if after I leave he realizes what he was doing is wrong? What if I hurt him by leaving him? He always repeats how he would die without me and making plans about our future. 

I am so doomed.  But I am unhappy.
",Preparing To Leave
Planning my exit but confused.,6,"I have taken so many steps to start planning my exit/divorce from husband of four years who has been psychologically and physically abusive on-off for the past two years. 

I have an emergency bag prepared should he become violent.
I’m seeing my therapist weekly to flush out the steps towards a likely divorce.
I’m grieving the loss of the marriage and all the dreams that came with this life together.
I got back on birth control. 
I set up a consultation with a Family Law Atty who specializes in domestic violence.
My parents and sister know I am considering leaving.

But tonight felt like he had a breakthrough. I KNOW I’m just being affected and swayed because he finally admitted he grew up in an abusive home. He seems like he understands my concerns why mild violent behavior is still scary and intimidating to me. 

I know that my emotions and empathy towards him are trying to pull me back from the almost certain decision towards divorce. 

Any wisdom from the weeks prior to leaving or filing for divorce would be appreciated. I barely feel strong enough to leave, and fear that I will “not be giving him enough time to change.” 

The reasonable half of my brain knows these emotions can’t be trusted. Even after all this I have such a hard time believing he is manipulating me even though all the signs point to manipulation. 

I’m hanging on to my wits, wisdom, and anger to guide the way out. ",Preparing To Leave
Safety and security tips for domestic violence situations (please add any others you can think of),3,"Below are some safety and security tips, broken up by phase. 

**When at home, planning to leave**

**Avoid unexplained changes**. The general idea is to not make any sudden changes to your routine, practices, or other behaviors unless they can be readily explained. For example, a “cover story” should be created for why you’re setting money aside if asked

**Remember Need to Know**. Only tell people about your plans if they absolutely need to know and can be trusted. Limit the number of people that know your plan; even if you trust them, they may be tricked into giving up your location

**Be careful of your browsing history**. Most browsers keep a record of websites you visit. Whenever you’re researching new locations, shelters, or anything else related to you plan, use “private browsing” or “incognito” mode. Alternately, download the Tor Browser Bundle to browse securely. Although the Tor Browser Bundle is a secure, private way to browse the internet, be aware that it runs from a folder that may be found. You can hide this folder or run it from a thumb drive for added security.

**Keeping a “Go bag”.** It’s a good idea to pack a “go bag” with enough clothes, money and essentials to last for a few days, as well as important documents and records. However, this bag must not be kept anywhere that can be found. Keep it at a safe location, such as work, a storage locker, a trusted (and preferably not mutual) friend’s house, etc.

**Prepare, but don’t spend too much time preparing**. The longer you take to prepare, the greater the chance of detection. Life and safety is more important than any possession; if you need to leave, leave as soon as you can. If you have time to take the bare essentials, do so.

**Bring as much cash as possible**, or know where you can borrow some. Do not use credit cards if the abuser has any way of seeing what’s been charged and where. If you borrow money, make sure it’s from a trusted friend or relative that has no connection to the abuser.

**Tell your kids what they need to know**. Children are likely aware of the violence, but may not be sure what they can or can’t share. Tell them that if there’s violence, it’s their job to get to safety, not to intervene. Teach them how to find a safe place and call 911. Establish an “emergency word” to use with your children, which would indicate that they need to get to an established safe area.

**Document the abuse**. Take photos of injuries and save any written or recorded threats. Keep a journal documenting incidents. All of this information should be kept in a place inaccessible by the abuser, such as a secure email account

**Know what to do if you’re in immediate danger**. Move away from anywhere with dangerous objects, such as the kitchen or bathroom. If possible, secretly designate an area of the house as ‘secure’ by moving any dangerous objects out of it. This area should also offer clear escape routes

**Know your escape routes**. Plan ahead for which routes offer quick and safe escape routes. Practice the routes with your children, and establish a code word so they know when to escape and call the police. Make sure they understand to keep this code word secret

**Avoid wearing necklaces or scarves**

**Secure weapons**. Keep guns locked up and unloaded; secure bladed weapons

**While traveling to a safe location**

**Don’t take the most direct route** to your destination. When you leave, head off in the opposite direction from where you’re actually headed, just in case someone sees you leave and may tell the abuser which direction you went. Afterwards, double back and take another route to your actual destination. 

**Know what to look** for to make sure you’re not being followed. Look several car lengths back, not just immediately behind you. If you think you’re being followed, simple checks can help to make sure. For example, make a u-turn and see if anyone else does the same thing. Drive slightly below the speed limit and see if anyone doesn’t pass you. Make a series of turns and see if the same car follows you. If you feel you’re being followed, pull into a police station parking lot or call the police. 

**If your vehicle has OnStar or a similar service**, call to either cancel tracking entirely or set a password to ensure no one else can find the vehicle’s location using their “find my family” service.

**The first 24 hours**

**Consider a protection order**, but remember that the order itself offers no protection. But if it’s violated, inform the police immediately

**Change website passwords.** Even if you’re pretty sure that no one else knew them. Make sure to change your social media, bank and email passwords. Take this opportunity to enable two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as multifactor authentication. This can help protect your account even if your password is compromised. 

**Get a new phone**. One option is to purchase an inexpensive, reloadable cell phone from any major retailer. These phones, commonly referred to as “burner phones” will have no connection to the abuser and can help you keep in touch with your support system. Another option is to visit a retail location for your provider and have them move you over to a new plan. If they don’t offer you a new phone with the plan, make sure they perform a factory reset of the device to ensure any apps that could track your location are removed. 

**While at a shelter**

Depending on the nature of the shelter, you may be asked to follow specific security rules designed to protect you, other residents, and the shelter staff. Although those rules may sometimes seem a little bit restrictive, it’s important to follow them for everyone’s safety.

If the abusive partner had access to your cell phone or your account, you may be asked to remove your phone’s battery, and maybe even wrap it in tinfoil to block any transmissions. Although this may sound a little bit extreme, this might be done because a cell phone may be used to track you or find out where you’re going. 

**At a hotel**

**Choose a secure hotel**. Look carefully at the hotel before registering. Can someone get inside without a keycard, except through the main entrance? Are the grounds well-lit and maintained? Are there cameras in the hallways and lobbies? Does the staff appear attentive? Does the door have a deadbolt and peephole?

**If possible, pay in cash**. If that’s not possible, pay using a credit card that has no connection to the abuser.

**When making reservations, instruct the hotel staff not to disclose your name** or confirm your presence to anyone, no matter who they say they are (including spouse or relatives); also tell them to inform you if anyone is is asking about you. They will note this in your file, which will pop up whenever they look up your information. Also instruct them not to give a copy of your key or keycard to anyone but you.

**Call the front desk to confirm any unrequested deliveries** to your room. Don’t open the door until you’ve confirmed this.

**Use additional security measures**. Portable locks and telescoping door jambs are inexpensive and effective ways to make a room more secure.

**Request a room on the fourth through sixth floor**. You’re less likely to have a break-in if you’re not on the ground floor, and the sixth floor is the limit for most fire department ladders.

**While at work**

Remember that this is where you will be the most exposed in your daily life, particularly if you are still at the same job that you had before you left. 

**Come up with a safety plan at work**. Your employer can screen your calls, assign a new phone number, move your desk, and provide an escort to your car.

**If available, ask for a transfer** and make sure all of your coworkers know not to disclose where you moved to. This is usually pretty simple, and most employers are understanding regarding this matter.

**Provide a photo of the abuser to building security**. This would allow quick identification and make sure they know not to allow them into the building.

**When you reach your new place**

**Set phone passwords for utilities and services**. Call services like any utilities and your phone company to ensure that no information is given out without a phone password that only you know. 

**Establish a “safe word” for your children**. Decide on a word that can be given to your children in the event that you need someone to pick them up from school or daycare. This word should only be given to trusted individuals when needed and changed after use. Do not give the safe word to anyone until it is needed.

**Tell your employer and children’s daycare what they need to know**. Develop a safety plan with both, but limit what you tell them to what they need to know. Make sure that your employer and daycare provider know about any protection orders and what to do if the abuser shows up

**Upgrade the security as much as possible**. Consider deadbolts, door prop guards, external lighting, alarms, etc. Anything that can be done helps. If renting, make sure your landlord changes the locks before you move in.

**Do a quick safety check when you get home**. Look for anything unusual or signs of entry. Check for broken windows, open doors, fresh footprints, etc. If anything looks unusual, call the police to have them perform a courtesy check.

**Protect your new address**. 32 States have an Address Confidentiality Program (ACP), which gives victims of domestic violence a confidential mail forwarding service and a legal address for all forms and state agencies. Ask your local courthouse if such a program exists in your state. If this isn’t an option, consider a PO box for all mail.

**Change up your routes** to work, school, daycare, and other frequent destinations

**Tell schools and daycare who can and can’t pick up your children**. If there’s a protective order in place, make sure they know about it

**Consider which neighbors you can give some details to**. They can let you know if they see the abuser or their car in the area.

**Take Special care to protect this information (as in, make sure not to say or do things that could reveal the following):**

* The route you intend to take when leaving, where you plan on going and who will help you along the way
* Where your emergency clothing, supplies, money, and documents are kept. Also, try to hide the fact that those things are being moved at all
* Any emergency code words, such as those used with children to indicate safety or danger
* New, private bank accounts
* Phone records and web searches related to the escape plan
* New job and new home location
* Alarm codes, passwords, and pin numbers
* Date and time of planned departure
* The purchase of specialized clothing that may indicate the planned destination (e.g. cold or warm weather clothing)

This information isn’t hard to protect, but it can help make sure the escape plan goes off without any problems. Just think about what sort of thing can give away that information, and make sure to protect it. ",Preparing To Leave
Need advice recovering from abuse,9,"TL;DR - Was stuck in an extremely emotionally abusive 
relationship with a small side of physical abuse trying to figure out how to cope and re-create my identity and learn to live alone after being paired with somebody from 17-22.


To preface this post she in her teens was diagnosed with a personality disorder which would show itself in the form of extremely volatile outbursts triggered from seemingly nothing. She also had a long childhood history of abuse. She was also previously arrested and charged with domestic assault towards me around 16 months ago.


Since I was 17 I've been in a relationship with a girl that I knew from high-school. For the last four years of this five year relationship I've felt like I'm walking on eggshells, anything I said or did I would closely monitor to insure that I wasn't going to somehow trigger her, leaving me living in a constant state of anxiety. To preface this post she in her teens was diagnosed with a personality disorder which would show itself in the form of extremely volatile outbursts triggered from seemingly nothing. 
She also had a long childhood history of abuse.


I am around 6'2 - 220 lbs. she is around 5'3 - 140. The size difference played a massive role in the abuse. To give some insight into the abuse that I'm trying to recover from I'll provide some examples.


She would block the door out of our apartment when I needed to leave for work, saying if I wanted to leave I would have to put hands on her. If I put hands on her or tried to squeeze by her she would immediately enter a hyper-vigilant state of ""self-defense"" and begin to assault me physically until she no longer felt threatened. Which resulted with me being left with multiple black eyes, clawed up face, and scarred teeth marks on my chest. I was always told by her that if I wanted to get my way (to leave for work, or be with my family for a planned dinner) that to get past her I would have to call the police and that ""I will lie and you know I will."" Was a favorite quote of hers.


Emotional abuse would be triggered by things like me shaking out a garbage bag too close to her while preparing to put it in the trash can which would ""hurt her ears"" and cause her to scream terrible things at me at the top of her lungs until I would say sorry and hug her.


My only way out of confrontation with her was to say ""I'm sorry you're right"" and then keep my mouth shut while she would scream things at me like ""Without me you're alone."" ""You can't do anything without me, you have nobody else who really cares about you or knows you"".


I spent five years walking on eggshells, I recently reached the point where I would wake up and not leave bed until she was ready (as me getting out of bed before her was a sign that I didn't care about her in her mind). I would spend my day trying to avoid conversation with her as I felt like no matter what we talked about I would somehow trigger her, and I simply couldn't handle the mental stress anymore.


When she assaulted me around 16 months ago, the police were called due to the noise and she was arrested due to the marks on me and her lack of cooperation. I throughout the whole court process did everything I could to help her case. I said it was my fault, that I initiated (which wasn't true), Because I was stuck in this situation of being terrified of losing the person I love while also being terrified of the other side of that person who caused me so much consistent pain.


I was in a constant battle of of weighing my need for her companionship and love versus all of the negative incidents which I haven't even scraped the surface of. I remember always hearing about abusive relationships and thinking ""why wouldn't they just leave?"" and I now know how much more complex and trapped an individual can really feel.


This last month was my birthday, my sister posted on my facebook wall and I commented on my sisters post thanking her for the message. My girlfriend also posted on my wall, except at 2am when I was getting into bed, so all I did was 'like' it and text her thanking her for the message. (she was visiting with friends at the time in a different state)


This difference in response triggered her, when she returned to the apartment the next day she told me to leave, after a long arguement of me saying I haven't done anything wrong and shoulnd't be expected to leave, she stated that she would destroy my property until I left. She threw my laptop, dumped a cup of water all over my desk + work files, and attempted to throw my pets cage with the pet inside of it.


When I tried to physically intervene I quickly caught some punches and left the property, went to my fathers house and we contacted the police. I had video evideence of this situation + many in the past + texts + images of abuse at length. The police helped gather her things and she was advised not to return. The police advised that I file a restraining order.


It took so long to get out of this relationship because I always tried my hardest to accommodate her behavior due to her mental illness. I had just hit my breaking point a long time ago. Now I'm in the situation where I am feeling the pain of being ""alone"" after a five year relationship. I lost my companion, the person I love, my best friend. (she also took our cat with her). I'm trying to figure out how I re-develop my identity as this relationship lasted through a huge transitional portion of my life (17-22, was there for me through divorce, loss of family etc).


I have a very supportive family who has made it very clear that they're here for me, I'm also just currently in a constant state of anxiety as I don't feel I can face her in court to fulfill the restraining order. (trespass papers have been served).
If anybody has any similar stories or advice or anything to say I would greatly appreciate it. I'm sorry for the somewhat jumbly post my mind has far too many directions to take every sentence of what I've just written in.

This is the most difficult thing I’ve ever done,9,"First time posting and on mobile, so I apologize for formatting. I’m 25(f) and have been with my husband for 8 years, married for 6. We have a 6 year old daughter in common. For the majority of our married life, he’s been abusive physically, emotionally, financially and on a rare occasion sexually. I’ve always just dealt with it, because leaving him meant he has nothing. He has no family, no friends around, no job (he refuses to work), no money, absolutely nothing. 

His abuse hasn’t been easy to deal with, and I pride myself on my resilience. He’s extremely jealous and controlling. He goes through my phone whenever he wants, and nitpicks conversations to start fights and accuse me of cheating. He doesn’t let me out with friends, especially anyone besides my one best friend (who also dates his brother). I’m not allowed to touch my phone in the morning until I’m walking out the door for work, and can’t use it outside of his presence when I’m home. He even constantly tracks my location, and if it pings anywhere but where he believes I should be, I’m met with rage and accusations. He sits home all day, smokes weed that I pay for, which I don’t even smoke, and we cannot afford it by any means, but not complying means being met with violence. He hasn’t held a steady job in years, but doesn’t help with taking care of our daughter either, for example; I have to take my hour lunch at work to get her off of the school bus and make her dinner, but he’s home and doing nothing but playing video games.

When things get violent, it always starts as me not wanting to follow his demands about something, whether it be quitting my job and finding a new one (he succeeded with this once before), not buying him weed, not cleaning up after him, and countless other things. It usually starts with shoving and him screaming in my face, and in some cases has led to being punched in the face or being almost choked out on the floor. This never happens in front of our child, thankfully. The threats of violence are frequent though, almost multiple times daily.

I don’t know if it’s a typical victim mindset, but I don’t let it completely get to me, and I am not broken. I argue back, I defend myself to the best of my ability (I’m 5’5 and pretty average, he’s 6’1 and has an athletic background), and I tell him this will eventually lead to me leaving, to which his response is usually “try me, it’ll be the last thing you ever do”. That doesn’t shake me. He’s a coward.

We got into an argument because I couldn’t take an hour break to cook dinner as well as get my daughter off of the school bus. He wouldn’t let me leave. I beg and plead, but eventually cave and begin to cook. Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now. I yell back, something about him not having a job and he grips me up from behind with an arm around my throat, and I grab the knife I was using to cut chicken and tell him to get off of me. He lets go, and we scream a bit more. I made a smart remark, and he jabbed me in my face. It busted the inside of my lip and I was bleeding. There is no worse feeling than loving someone to death and having to ask yourself why this is happening. I finished dinner, and went back to work in tears. 

Two days later, I’m driving him to a job interview with a company he’s been anxious to work for, and he’ll accept no other job because this is what he wants to do. He’s screaming in my face so aggressively that I can’t even wrap my head around feeling that type of rage. It’s my fault that he forgot his belt, my fault that I don’t carry nail clippers, I need to get him weed right after the interview, even though I had plans to go to the DMV. He says he doesn’t even feel like going through this interview because he doesn’t want to work 20 minutes away. This is my breaking point. While he’s in the interview, and I’m melting in the car because of how hot it is out, I call my best friend. Today is the day.

I take him home, and act normal. While he smokes and is playing Xbox, I quietly pack my and my daughters things and take them to the car. My mother was visiting for the day, and she helped. I tell him we’re going to see if the DMV is still open, and we’ll be back later. I hop in my car with my possessions, my mom follows with my daughter. We go to the police station, where my best friend meets us, and I file for a temporary restraining order. They take pictures of my lip, and a statement, then I speak with a judge. Order is granted. They arrest him, and bring him to county jail and I’m given possession of the apartment and custody of my daughter. 

Fast foreword to today. He got out of jail last night, and his brother got him a hotel room. My husband told his brother everything that happened, from being jumped and stabbed in jail (I saw a picture of the wound), to walking for hours trying to get anywhere in just socks in a rural area (we’re in Southern NJ). This is where things go downhill again. He had a hearing about his assault charge, and the police who arrested him are trying to encourage him to press aggravated assault charges against me for having a knife. They’re also involving CPS/ DYFS because we both appear violent. How can me breaking free from years of torment turn on me? Now I can lose my daughter because I grew balls and went to the police? Honestly, I’m pretty broke, I have no savings, and can not afford an attorney. I’m currently searching for one that may help for free, but today is Saturday, and the final restraining order hearing is Thursday. His pretrial for the assault is Monday, where it’ll be decided if he’s pressing charges and DYFS will speak with him, according to his brother. 

I need some advice, reassurance, something because this is a disaster I wasn’t prepared for. I’d rather be punched in the face every day than run the risk of losing my daughter. Sorry for the length of the post, I needed to get this all out.",Preparing To Leave
Where are the shelters that people say you can go too?,1,"I live in the southeast u.s.a. So it’s rural n conservatives. 

I live in the biggest city in my state and there are only a few dv houses, some of which onfl accep women with kids witch it great but I don’t have any. Of the ones I qualify for, all are full all the time. I called every day off and on for months (every day 1 week). They say u have to get there the same day someone leaves or you can’t have a spot. One lady told me to wait outside downtown for days and just be homeless until a spot opens. I have tried to prepare for being homeless aand on the streets downtown but I’m scared. It’s a rly damgerous city. 

So does any wine know of anywhere where there are actually resources availavle? Icant hice enough money for an apartment to leave but maybe I could get enough to a train to a different city or state. I don’t know anyone here who could help me my family is from different country and I’m not even really allowed to have contacts with them.

I’m scared to get authorities involved because of my citizenship status. I would even leave the country if I could I don’t mean to  impose likethis but I need help to get in my feet and then I will plan on returning to my familiys.

I am in the cab on my way out of an abusive relationship in a corrupt foreign country. I need people to lean on while he comes home to discover I've left. I'm scared.,5,"Last year put me in a very vulnerable place and I decided to move from the US to China with a man that seemed like a dream. There were some small warning signs but I thought if things got bad I would just easily leave. He is well off and spoiled me and became devoted to me very, very quickly. I stupidly decided to give ""such a great guy"" a chance.

Six months later, last weekend, he threw me against the wall by my throat and held me up against the wall by my throat as I cried in fear. 

Of course before this was a big huge fight very late at night. He had been drinking. I came home late. It's a long story that I will definitely write about it later along with everything I went through and the stupid mistakes I made and the chances I gave thinking he was just a messed up person that had been given a hard hand in life. From what I've read so far, typical abuser behavior. Multiple threats of suicide (one involved him taking a knife with him in the bathroom after a crazy abusive fight, one involved him taking a bunch of pills with lots of liquor and he stopped breathing at one point), more than once straight up accusing me of cheating, always suspicious and claiming I am doing things behind his back, alcoholism, pills, claiming he will change, saying he wants to change, blaming alcohol, blaming his family, blaming work, blaming me, the whole works. 

I have known for some time that I would definitely be leaving and after last weekend (not to mention that he has barely said anything about what he did but has repeatedly casually chastised me for staying out late) I have been searching online and on reddit and someone from twox linked to [""The Loser"" by  Dr. Joe Carver](http://www.drjoecarver.com/clients/49355/File/IdentifyingLosers.html). I have found it  extremely helpful.  It all makes sense now. I understand so much now. 

As I write this, I am now at my new apartment. All my things are in bags and suitcases. 

He gets home from work soon and he will find that I and all my things are gone. My stomach is in knots. I am far away from him but I am still scared. He will call me a  thief for taking presents he gave me. He will say I am a horrible person in part for leaving while he was gone. He will freak out and storm my phone with texts and who knows what else. Calls non stop? Hate filled accusatory emails? I want to block him but I also want verifiable proof of threats and other insanity. I also want to know if he is crazy mad or if he doesn't care, mostly for my own sense of safety. How on guard do I need to be? I guess I won't really be able to tell from his texts or emails since in person and sober he is .....less of a monster.

I am scared. I am scared for my safety. He will have no way of knowing where I am but I am scared I will run into him. I am afraid of being alone if/when I do.  I do not speak the language yet here partly because my life has been so fucking stressful and insane in the months we've been here. I focused more on escaping in my mind than preparing. Stupid but I was under lots of stress and confused about what was really going on. I was unsure if he could change, was it the alcohol, was it me, was it adjustment? Now I know it isn't me. I've made a few friends without him, quickly without him actually, and I feel a lot better but this is all super super new.

I am counting the minutes until he starts texting me or calling me once he gets home. 

Please just..... I dunno.... make me feel less alone please? If you could? If you have time or a sentence or a happy kitten picture?  My family has no idea and the two friends that do...well, I'm ashamed to tell them the real truth. This is not me. This is not me. But it is right now and it's almost over but I am scared. I'm alone now in a corrupt foreign country where I don't speak the language. I have a job lined up. I am staying here. This is my dream. I'm not going to go home because of him. I'm going to do this on my own. I will make friends. I will get better at my job. I will be free and I will have fun and it will be better than I ever imagined. The little bit of fun and friends I have made in the last very few weeks have given me a glimmer of hope. I have seen that what I have sought is really put there- fun people that want to be happy and are naturally happy like me! I have been on the verge of tears for about an hour. Maybe after writing that it will be happy tears now....but....I think it's 50/50 with fear of the shit storm that I will have on my phone in about... any minute now.

I have everything packed but I think I will try to go out tonight, or at least be around people. I have no bed sheets though.... Maybe I will start there.

Tick tock.

My Domestic Violence story..,2,"When I was 18 I fell in love with a man who was ten years older than me. I felt like he could protect me. I trusted him because I didnt know how to look for the signs. 
He was living with his parents at the time and considered himself an entrepreneur, I thought it was because he was a highly creative and drivin individual, but he was just a two count felon. At 19 freshly graduated I started to hangout with his older friends and partied. We took a trip out on a river and had drinks with two other adults. It was quickly turning to night fall and I could see his personality change in his eyes. We all got off tge raft on the the beach and he looked back at me pushed me on to the sharp rocks and told me I wasnt worthy of him. Many more horrendous things happened that night but that was the first red flag. I told myself it was only the alcohol. That he would never treat me like that if he hadn't had so much that night. But throught our days together he would slip small demeaning insults. Things to make me feel small. It was done so often and in manipulative ways that I didnt see it anymore. I few years go by and we save up to get an apartment. He wanted it to be far away from our families because they were ""controlling and wouldnt let me grow to my potential"". We moved from VA to FL. Now I see he just wanted me to have no way out. I was there a year. Constantly having to work 70 hours to cover the rent because he needed to fullfil his dreams. I wanted to support him. But when I would come home he would be drunk. And I walked on eggshells untill morning because my this point I had already learned that if I said anything to him I would be thrown around the house. I worked as a maid so I couldn't afford to have vissible bruises or to be so sore from the blows. My birthday came around and my family came down to visit and gave me the opportunity to go back home. I took it and eventually went back because I never blocked him out. 
Abusers know what to say to you to get you to feel bad for them. For you to break and forgive. This time was worse and I eventually got the courage to call the police. He took a wine bottle opener and hit me across the brow bone. I remember being terrified, I remeber seeing two empty bottles, I remember crawling to the bedroom and locking myself in the closet. I called my only friend there and she told me to call the police. I did and she came prepared with pepper spray. She was the only one who had any idea. And she saved my life. My abuser had run out of the apartment and left to the gas station to get more alcohol. The police apprehended him as I was being taken by an ambulance. I guess they wanted to be sure that i wasbt going to lose my eye or had a concussion. I was lucky and came out with a shiner. But this wasnt the worst of the violence. I was just brave enough that night. Because I had someone who had my back. 

I had a case against him. But he was moved over to a different court system for veterans. He is being treated for schizophrenia and alcoholism. I dont know how he was so protected. But its been four months and I think its time to actually heal. I share my story because its nessesary to let others know that they are not alone. Let everyone around you know. Dont be affraid to get out. I used to feel like I was insane. I may be a bit crazy but im not sick. Know it isnt you. And know that the only way from getting out of an abusive relationship is up. 

Im not a writer so im sorry if this is rough. It was also typed out on my phone.

Thank you for reading and listening.

Indirectly involved in domestic violence between my fiancée and her ex-husband--reaching out...,14,"I will try to make this as brief as possible, I'm not sure of anything right now as I have never been involved with anything like this--and I'm not quite sure what I'm feeling, outside of nervous, upset and a lot of anxiety.

Quickly about us--I'm a 40 year-old man, divorced once with no children. I make a decent living as a web developer, own a home, a couple of vehicles, etc. Not unexpected from a 40 year-old man; but, will be a bit pertinent a later in my post. 

I'll also include that I'm an Army veteran of 8 years, so I'm not unfamiliar with what violence can lead to, and consider myself to be a problem-solving, peaceful pacifist to an extent today. My fiancée and I practice zero tolerance for violence in our home--in any form.

My fiancée is 37 and has four children from her previous marriage. Her experience with her ex-husband (as she describes) was turbulent, with her ex-husband exacting fear and psychological abuse as his primary tools. She would continue to go back to him, over and over despite how she was treated. 

The children are all aged according to the pattern of her leaving and then going back (12, 11, 8, 7). The abuse eventually escalated to physical and ultimately led to him attempting to run her over with a car in 2009.

She was finished with the violence and abuse and he was arrested, charged and convicted of domestic violence and assault (although he pleaded for her to come back). He had much of his contact with the children limited for several years.

Her ex-husband worked hard and put his life back together, stayed out of trouble and was able to have more rights and unsupervised visits to the children--my fiancée was not bitter and fully allowed him visitation and was accommodating to his requests to see the children. He barely spoke to her, but things were civil (although he never supported her or the children financially).

In 2014 my fiancée and I met, fell in love and that did not sit well with her ex-husband. He didn't like anything about me--and he'd never actually said one word to me (and still hasn't in 2 years). During his time with the kids, he'd make it known to them that he hated me for having material things and that their mother had ruined his life, etc. 

The positive in me, kept giving him the benefit of the doubt, despite what he'd done in the past. I respected him for working hard, trying to get better, helping financially where he could, etc. And he would know all of this if he would have just spoken to me like an adult.

I stayed out of the relationship between my fiancée and him 100%. They have a strange custody agreement in place that I had nothing to do with--again, I stay out of it. 

Until eight weeks or so ago.

Full disclosure--I love these kids like they were my own and I would do anything to protect them.

The kiddos started eluding that things weren't great when they were at the ex's home. They explained that the ex and his girlfriend were drinking a lot while they were there and encouraged the kids to hit each other as a way to deal with their problems--that led to some notable incidents while they were at our home. My fiancée and I were not happy.

The older two started confiding in their mother a bit more--saying they were scared to go there, but not giving out much more information as they, ""Didn't want to get dad in trouble.""

This raised some obvious red flags with both of us--but her ex does not talk to my fiancée at all. When she tried, he asked to be excused. He's painted this picture in front of the children that their mother ruined his life and she'd do it again had she the chance...

One month ago, the two oldest were a bit more candid--and started to tell us both how the 11 year-old (boy) is hit by their dad--daily. Alarmed, I try to get some context and think things through logically. They stated he is mad--I explained the difference between being upset and mad, and they assured us it was the latter.

At this point, I wasn't quite sure of what to do. The kids described being hit in the face, back of the heads and shoved. So, I suggested that we retain a lawyer for advice and council.

We did this and my fiancée explained everything to him--he thought it might be difficult in our state to fully prove things, so his advice was to file paperwork to have the 'odd' custody agreement adjusted--to do things properly.

My fiancée warned myself and her lawyer that her ex's pattern is that he starts with psychological abuse and moves to physical  (to the point she feared for her life).

The smaller children have started to report physical abuse on the others as well and never want to go to his home.

My fiancée's chief concern is for the safety of her children and the kids themselves have said they want something to be done, but they were worried about the fallout from their father (as is my fiancée--she was apprehensive about talking to a lawyer for fear of what me might do).

Tonight, during custody exchange, my fiancée was loading the kiddos into her ex's truck. I usually stand at the door to wave them off as I don't want to cause any conflict.

My fiancée was putting the youngest in her seat, and about to buckle her belt, when I saw her ex shift the car and start to pull forward with my fiancée still in the door jam. He stopped suddenly, she finished, backed away and he sped up the street, door barely closed.

I'm out the front door at this point, barely believing what I had just witnessed--she turned to me, and I asked if something was said--she said no and that he was agitated.

I'm upset at this point, I explained that we had two choices--either we were both going to the police station, or I was going alone. She chose to come, and the whole time I knew that I was now smack in the middle of this.

I wasn't even sure if what he'd done was illegal or anything, but I needed to know now what could be done about it. 

We drove to the substation and I was having some doubts about doing it, I'm thinking to myself, ""This is going to impact someone's life in a very negative way, very, very negatively."" I felt guilty for doing it.

We found a police officer,  he explained what her options were--nothing, or file a charge--and once that happened, there would be no turning back.

My stomach churned and my adrenaline was coursing. I couldn't believe that he had actually done this--to the woman I love, in front of the children I love, in front of my home.

My fiancée finished telling the officer her account, I looked at her and said, ""Do you want to go through with this?"" She said that she did and the officer said that he had already made the decision for her...

He's going to be charged. They'll either go to his home tonight or he will be served with a warrant, ultimately he will go to jail and our lives have been changed.

I'm a part of this now.

For the first time, I truly understood that my fiancée fears for her life.

I'm not sure of what will happen in the coming week, I'm trying to prepare myself. I have some anxiety, and I also worry if we made the right decision--this is someone's life. And although I've never spoke to him, he's the father of the kids that I love.

?traumatic brain injury? Is that an excuse?,9,"I am such a long time lurker on Reddit and have gotten lost down many rabbit holes and also found a lot of helpful advice. So I thought it couldn't hurt to post here as I am in a total quandary at the minute. Also this is my first post so I'm not sure if formatting etc will be correct, please just let me know.


So a little back story, I am 26 and a female in the U.K. I am a student nurse, hold a full time job and have a mortgage with my fiancé (?ex fiancé). We have been together for 4 years, lived together for 2. He also works full time and we were pretty happy together. Been engaged a year, wedding booked for next July. For all intents and purposes we have a pretty good life. But there's a catch. 

He's been violent pretty much since 6months in. Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me. I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards. A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition, got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc. I went to the police and they issued him with a domestic violence order. They thought this was unusual since the only record remotely like this he had was that he had sought the same type of order on his ex (some complication with needing her off the mortgage, I'm not sure). Anyway yeah so I got that, didn't see or speak to him for months then for some forgotten reason we ended up in contact and he was adamant he'd changed and loved me and it would never happen again, he'd been suicidal since we split up etc etc. I felt so sorry for him and agreed to give it another go. 

Since then so for the last 3 years there has been sporadic violence towards me. He has a generally angry outlook on life and rages so easily which is the total opposite to my personality. 

2 years ago we decided to live together, I wanted to rent to test the water but he refused so we ended up buying. The first few months the house almost went on the market every week due to arguments and violent outbursts but never anything where I thought 'I need to get help' I always thought I could manage him. Plus I fear the police wouldn't take me seriously having gone back to him after the dvo. Plus we had our 2 doggos by this point and he refused to let me have them if I left so I stayed. 

One night after trying to physically throw me out of the house and then stamping on me I said unless he gets help for his anger I was gone. (Yes I know but I thought I could fix it). He went to 6 weeks, complained the whole time about the cost and that he wasn't getting anything out of it. Despite this for the past year there has been no violence. 

He proposed June last year, I said yes (I'm not sure why) and we were happily planning our wedding. However the past few weeks I've been feeling the strain. The anxiety of getting married (coupled with my already present anxiety) made me stop opening up to him, drinking more and we were like strangers. This made him frustrated. 

In this past few months he has also started chasing after/ confronting strangers if they do the slightest thing to annoy him and nothing I say or do stops him. His memory has become terrible, he will ask me the same question each 15 minutes to the point I thought he was taking the piss. All this I could deal with because no violence and I'm busy with work etc. 

However on Friday just gone I decided to go out with my best friend, after coming home tipsy but perfectly fine he punched me after I said something like 'well could you not have walked the dogs before now?' After he accused me of being selfish to them. Bearing in mind he'd been in the house all night on PS4. So I was shocked, I broke my ring finger trying to stop him punching me. So I said that's it, went to bed. 

Unfortunately we had a huge family wedding the next day (nobody is aware of our problems) and I didn't have an excuse or the willpower to try and get out of it so I said fine, we'll play nice today then after that it's over. Went to wedding covering all my bruises engagement ring on, he's the perfect gent. After the wedding we went out to our local town where I met some friends and their partners. Me and my girlfriends were dancing and he was socialising. To cut a long story short (ha,sorry,irony) he took a dislike to a guy dancing near me and proceeded to beat the living shit out of him. Nobody could drag him off then all of a sudden he said 'I've had enough' and stormed home. I ran after him in blind panic but he locked me out of the house in the rain with no shoes. I was a whore,a slut,I had no respect, I could say goodbye to the dogs and my house etc he was shouting. Eventually he let me in and because I grabbed some stuff and said I was leaving he shouted 'I'll show you some fucking respect' and headbutted me and shattered my nose. This is the furthest he has ever gone and I panicked and when I tried to get up off the floor he stood on me and laughed. I can't remember how but I got up, cleaned up all the blood got changed and rang a friend to come and pick me up where I stayed for the next 2 nights. They tried to convince me to go to the police, stripped me and photographed my bruises etc and tried to get me to tell my parents. None of which I was mentally prepared to do. His job requires dbs check so he would lose that if he got arrested. If he lost his job I couldn't afford to keep the house as a student etc etc. (All material things I know) 

Fast forward to today, I'm back at work as of Monday, haven't been to the hospital or police or parents. He is telling me he is suicidal and has a problem and he's scared of himself. I am so ready to fix what needs sorted and leave. But then he tells me he's been to the doctors who he told everything to and who saw the scars on his shaved head and questioned him about previous head injuries (he has had many but none checked out). So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage. At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. 
So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason? And if so what the fuck do I do? 

TL;DR my fiancé has a history of violence towards me. Now drs are questioning a previous traumatic brain injury and potential brain damage as a cause of his behaviour. As a nurse I am confused how I should feel or what to do. ",Preparing To Leave
Accidentally stabbed in hand preventing suicide - need advice,5,"No history of DV, married 8 years, together 10 years, nothing like this has ever happened before. We have two children, 2 & 5 that unfortunately witnessed nearly everything. Sunday night we had both been drinking, she was significantly more intoxicated than I (likely due to not eating much that day.) She came out of our bedroom and started ""doing"" the dishes - slamming everything in the process. 

I raised my voice telling her to go to bed and I would handle the dishes - she snapped, started screaming, hitting me in the chest (slapping to be a little more precise if alcohol+adrenaline actually allow for vivid memory recollection) before I know it she has a knife - I take it out of her hand and grab the second knife that was in sight (dinner had recently been prepared, we used multiple knives to do so) I threw them both in the trashcan, but her rampage continued and she soon had yet another knife in her hand, this time pointed directly (or close to) her heart, stating that she wanted it to all be over, never wanted any of this (we relocated 800 miles for my work approx 3 weeks ago and left behind every friend and family member we have that could help either of us right now) I grabbed both of her wrists and we struggled, we both hit the ground and I held her down until I could remove the knife from the situation - at some point I was stabbed just above my thumb even though I did not realize it until minutes later. (Turns out urgent care won't even touch my wound, I need to see a hand specialist due to the limited motion in my thumb and index finger, I don't know exactly how deep it is but I would guess 3/4"" to 1"")

Eventually she wanted to leave while she was still restrained, so I obliged. She left and things were calm - for a few minutes - then she started calling, and screaming outside, and slamming the back glass door so hard I thought it would shatter, (we keep a large fixed blade knife on the back porch in case critters decide to try anything crazy with us or our pets.) I did not want to involve the police, but I did not see any other valid option to keep my children out of harms way, as well as both of us. She was arrested on misdemeanor domestic assault. The court issued a no contact order, so we are not allowed to speak - I am the only listed victim, so she can still see the kids if somehow we can coordinate without breaching the no contact order. 

So, here's my dilemma - we work opposite shifts so we don't have to deal with daycare, obviously this is not going to work now. So I am looking for suggestions. I cannot afford all of the bills if I also need to pay for daycare, or a sitter for 40+ hours a week. 

Please allow me to state the following.
I do not believe my stab injury was intentional.
I do not want to permanently separate her from our children. 
I do want her to get mental help.
I cannot afford daycare at 40-50 hours per week by myself.
Neither of us can afford a second location for her to live during the no contact order, and we do not have a support system where we are - we just moved as I stated above.

What the hell do I do? She was released from custody today and has a hotel for one night, but I need to figure out a 3-6 month plan and I am striking out here. Any suggestions considering the unique situation above? Thank you to anyone who actually read through this wall of text, anything constructive is greatly appreciated.

"I [25F] was shoved on stairs by boyfriend [30M]. Conflicted and wary, need outside input to help think this through.",3,"I originally posted in r/relationships where I did get some helpful feedback but the mods eventually removed my post and told me to come here instead. I'm still very conflicted over this and need some input to help me deal with this. Here's my original post:

I forgot to make sure we remembered to get up early on a work day so we could then leave early to go to my doctor's appointment. We still left early and went, and are making up the couple of hours today. At the time he stressed that I shouldn't have forgotten and I apologised and took responsibility for the mistake. He downplayed how angry this made him and didn't let on at all during the workday or the ride to the doctor. Also worth mentioning he almost left even earlier because he wasn't feeling well, until I reminded him of the appointment.

When I got home he lit into me almost immediately with treatment I have been enduring for some time. Yelling that I'm a fuckup and that's all I am, that I never make progress (even though this same week he acknowledged progress in various things I've been doing) and I deserve shame and humiliation. He totally exploded at me. Eventually I got sick of being insulted and asking him to be calmer or at least not yell at me. I yelled back and decided to leave the house because I couldn't deal with it at that point. I know leaving pisses him off but when I try to get time to think or cool off, he never allows it (follows me into other rooms or around the house or office berating and mocking me).

He was screaming at me to get back there and also yelling my name. I heard him on the stairs behind me and then he forced his way past me and shoved me hard, which made me go down several steps and into the wall/corner where there are also the fittings for the banister sticking out. I cried out because it hurt. He didn't react to any of that at all and blocked the door with his whole body, saying he wouldn't allow me to leave and I would have to make him move physically. I called the police and he continued to mock me until he realised I was serious and got out of my way, so I canceled the police (stupid in hindsight). I left and just cried at the bus station for an hour or so.

When I got back he had taken a ton of stuff off the walls and shelves, including my stuff. He said there will be no happy memories around us. He also said he's going to make my life as difficult and unpleasant as possible in ways that the police will never be able to know about. This second half of the argument I was prepared for, unlike the first, and I recorded everything. 

I moved some of my stuff and slept in the guest room. We still have up until December on this lease together. I sponsor him in this country because he cannot stay on his own. We also work together. 

Today he was crying and begging me not to leave him (which I already had done) etc. I told him he needs mental health care - not for the first time - and that I can't trust him after what happened on the stairs because he crossed an even worse line than he has before with verbal abuse. He claims it was an accident and he tripped, but later in the same conversation he said it was because he needed to get to the bottom before me so he could block the door, so that's not much of an accident. 

My aunt is arriving today by coincidence and will stay with us. She is a terror and I will feel safe with her there. I'm just fucked up from all of this and needed to vent and also ask for some input from outsiders on this situation.

TL;DR Partner I live and work with shoved me into the wall during an argument. Need to stay strong and resist my urge to get back together. Looking for advice or analysis of situation to help me think.

(End of original post)

Since then he has been having more frequent breakdowns which were happening prior to this. He has lost his father and his great aunt who raised him both in the last year and 4 members of his family have developed cancer in the same period as well. He is from a third world country and most of his family is still there. He is dealing with extreme survivor's guilt and has even lost it when eating because he can't handle the fact that he gets to eat well when his family sometimes can't eat at all. He's deep in depression and anxiety. He is scheduled to get help starting next week (this appointment was made over a month ago so before the above incident). 

Given that I have suffered a mental breakdown myself, and I know his circumstances, I want to be understanding. However this has set a new precedent and I'm obviously wary and scared. My sensible side tells me that the first time this happens should be the last. The side of me that thinks about the difficult times I have been in and how that had a strong impact on everyone around me knows that things are complicated and not always cut and dry.

I don't know how to proceed. I'm just trying to figure this out.",Preparing To Leave
"In need of support, or advice, or something along those lines",14,"This is going to be a long, long post but I literately have no one in real life I can tell my full story to and I'm having a really rough time.

My husband and I started dating in 2008, it was always turbulent but not in a yelling/hitting kind of way. He would abruptly decided he needed space and not speak to me for months at a time. Roughly 5 years ago after a 8 month stint of ignoring my calls, then showing up out of the blue i sat him down and explained my needs and that that behavior was not going to be tolerated anymore. I let him know if he needed his space he could let me know and I'd oblige but going dark like that wasn't conducive to a healthy relationship.

From that point on I spent 5 nights a week there. We argued occasionally but there was never yelling or name calling or anything that could be perceived as a warning sign. We were to be married august 2013, and wanted to try to conceive January of 2014 but due to a mistake ended up pregnant late may. At that point our relationship changed drastically.

He wanted an abortion, and I said no. I told him if he wanted to leave me, I'd understand but that I would not be getting abortion. He took his time before deciding to stick out the relationship but he was distant and looked at me like I had let him down and retreated to his office to play video games upwards of 8-10 hours a day.

We coped with the stress of the unexpected pregnancy in different ways. Him with his computer, me by trying to be prepared as possible which to me meant insuring with or without him I would be able to care for our child. It pushed us apart even more and the dynamics of our relationship had changed drastically but we decided to proceed with the marriage regardless. Around november I started trying to reconnect but by that point he rejected every advance for intimacy I made (aside from sex) and I was frusterated from being rejected but kept trying.

When our daughter was born (January 2014) he said it would be too stressful for him to be there and miss work, even though they told him it was fine, and missed my entire labor. I called him before the emergency c section and he said he'd come, but didn't want to go back with me.
I stayed in the hospital 4 days afterwards and he visited one day for about 2 hours but other than that stayed home.

Needless to say parenthood wasn't at all what I expected. It was glorious and the happiest time in my life. I'd never loved anyone so much but throwing a baby in the mix of an already struggling relationship was certainly not helping our relationship anyway. To this day he has never woken up with her at night. He has never gotten up with her in the morning. He has never watched her while I showered. I have taken on 100 percent of the physical responsibility for our child, and I love the bond we have but I hurt that she has very little with her dad. He continued working 40 hours a week, playing video games around 40 a week, and then sleeping. 

This caused a lot of arguments and when our daughter was 6 months they turned physical. I was holding my daughter in the kitchen and he was yelling, i told him to stop and he pushed me into the stove. I was in shock and broke down crying and he said ""you should have left me alone"" and walked away.

I was stunned but he apologized and I figured that would be it. From that point on it was little things for a while. He would grab me and shake me, or I'd be sitting and he'd grab my shoulder and apply preassure. To be honest I was in denial. I didn't want to believe I could be in one of those relationships so instead I brushed it off.

Then he pushed me over the couch with my 1 year old in my arms. She got a bruise on her side from where I was holding her when it happened and I was so angry, and devasted I left. I demanded he see a psychiatrist and attend marital counceling before I would consider moving home. My first priority is my daughter and I wanted to keep her safe first and foremost but I also wanted her to have a functional family.

He got into a psychiatrist and we attended 3 marital counceling sessions before i moved back in about a month later. Things were great for roughly 3 weeks before the most recent situation.

We were argueing and I asked to drop it till marital counceling, he got angrier and started screaming awful things at me, I told him to stop and he bounded down the stairs, wrapped his hands around my neck and started squeezing and shaking me while screaming you will listen to me. Our daughter was in my arms so i tried to knee him which he averted and I hit him in the face and tried to get away but he twisted my arm behind my back. 20 seconds later he stopped and i picked up the phone and dialed 911, hung up, called a friend. He was going to work and I knew I'd have time to leave so I wasn't going to force police involvement but they showed up anyways, and he was arrested.

I panicked while he was in jail. Called his dad, went and requested a modified no contact order to allow electronic communication and packed all his personal belongings and took it to our mutual friends. His dad seemed supportive of me at the time and so did our mutual couple friend, but at this point they have all came out and shamed me for putting him through this. They have all explained that I should have just lied to the police and left. He feels while his actions were wrong, my betrayal in involving the police is worse so he doesn't know if he wants to continue this relationship, and obviously if that's how he sees it, I  can't continue because it's not safe for our child. I feel like a failure as a mother and as a wife and I have a whole lot of pride, am completely anti divorce, and have no idea what to do with myself. I love him, I love the relationship we had, and I just don't understand how after 7 years of never even raising his voice this happens. ",Preparing To Leave
It's never too late...,8,"I'm writing this post because our neighbors next door have been in a downward spiral in their relationship. 

The yelling, the crying, the sound of things being thrown around- it hurts. It hurts me. My abuser was my prince charming, my everything and my all. He hung the moon and the stars for me. We were married young and like all young adults you think you know everything. You think you are prepared for EVERYTHING. 

One day he comes home from being stationed away for training. (We were an Air Force family.) We'd had our fights here and there, but nothing aggressive or physical. That all changed when I didn't have dinner ready one evening. I'd never seen that side of him. My immediate reaction was ""What did I do? What can I do to change? I', so sorry."" It only progressed and got worse from there. Yelling turned to physical abuse, then he played the emotional game with me. ""If you leave me then I'll kill myself. I'm sorry, I'll change. Promise."" I painfully remember the nights full of yelling and tears. The begging for him not to leave and that I would change. The empty hours of promises. 

After months of abuse, emotional heart ache and physical pain my family welcomed me back home. I look back on our 4 year relationship and see so many red flags. The field looks like a penalty has been drawn but the players keep playing. His dad was an abuser, he was always so critical of everything I did, I was his possession, everything that went wrong was my fault, why did I do these things to hurt him, why would I ever think that he would like that.... the list goes on and on. 

Ladies and gents- it is NEVER too late to leave. It is NEVER too late to ask for help. Do yourself a favor... No matter how much you love them, no matter how much they say they will change; an abuser is always an abuser. Emotional, physical, mental and/or verbal... They will NEVER change.

"Help! I want to leave, can you help me make sure I'm about to do it right?",5,"I am in an emotionally abusive relationship. My husband and I have been going to counseling since mid-August and 2 weeks ago I told the counselor in a 1-on-1 that I was ready to leave. 

He asked if there was anything that would make me stay, because he saw hope for improvement in my H. I shrugged, and he suggested drawing a ""line in the sand."" So we did exactly that. He told my H in plain text, ""a line in the sand has been drawn. If you cross it, she will leave.""

Well yesterday he did just that. He started telling me again that my behavior was abusive! Alright, maybe I was being a little harsh in the way that I was talking, but...??? To me that's line crossed. I think he just doesn't like seeing me stick up for myself...

But we own a house together, make payments on 2 cars (he earns twice as much as I do), and have around $7,000 outstanding on the credit card I'm the primary on... (Holidays and we just bought new phones).

I have a lot at the house that I would want to take with me, but I know I'd be happy just taking some clothes, MY pets, and my computer. I can take time off work to take those things while he is at work. I can make sure my paycheck goes into an account that only my name is on and have his name removed from any joint accounts.

I get up to 20 hours free for lawyer services from my job (it rocks!) and then the rest I pay.

But he knows I'll go to my parents an hour away, he knows where I work. I don't want to stop working, I love my job and I have a few guardian angels at work who know what I'm going through. I know they'd worry for me.

I just don't know what to do about the house and cars...

Do I sound prepared in every other area though? Can I really just...leave?

I realized what was happening,9,"I know he's emotionally abusive from what I've been told by others.  I've read the information and agreed with him being an emotional abuser.  However, things have been going pretty well with the exception of the occasional names he calls me and arguments here and there.  But nothing major, the calm before the storm.
So today I was having a disagreement with someone about appts.  He starts yelling and the person practically runs away.  I was embarrassed and closed the door.  He comes down stairs and starts telling me I'm a push over and never stand up for myself etc.  I said ""perhaps you should have talked to them instead.""  He goes off yelling at me and saying he had to handle it and if I grew a backbone if stand up for myself.  Then saying he was being blamed now for what happened.  
At that moment I had absolute clarity and in the middle of my tears and his belittling me in front of the kids.  I said ""no one blamed you for anything, I never asked for your help and I was handling it as graciously as I could."" He was trying to turn it around and make himself the victim.  How he's sick in bed and trying to help and now I'm yelling at him.  
Then he tried to say I was lying and I have no idea how I was lying when I never asked for help.
I know he messed with my memories of stuff and makes me feel crazy and I can't tell what's real.  But if I had not had that moment of clarity I would've taken the blame and kept crying and he would've piled on insults.  It was like a slap in the face for him and he walked off into another room because I stood up for myself.

"The end of my ~11 year marriage was not the violence, but that I never told her after the first time that it's over if she hits me again. That was 12 years ago. If you're 'in', get out before you get hopelessly trapped.",5,"When my wife asked me in relationship counselling to tell our therapist what I did wrong, saying 'You think you did nothing wrong!' and I said, 'No, that's not true; I didn't speak up.' she was incredulous, wanting me to list all the times I've upset her to justify her assaults...

But I meant it: I believe it is at the very core of our troubles - my fear and desperation to please her at all costs were because I wasn't able to say how I wanted to be treated, fearing she'd take away her love. By the time I left it was too late for 'us', but not for me. 
I left her and everyone in our friend-circle behind and had a 3 month nervous breakdown. 

Now, 18 months later I'm an emotional wreck, mostly unemployed and drowning my sorrows with girls and cocktails - but there is light at the end of the tunnel, once we're divorced she'll have no financial control over my life and I can rebuild. I know I will... 

I will not let someone treat me in that way again and one day - sometime next year I'll be free to work out what I want to do with the ~40 years I have left in me.

I'm writing this because there'll be people in relationships here not knowing how to get out, and that for me it was a single sentence that left me deciding I'd had enough.

I left that day she broke a thread I'd not told her would snap at the next-little-thing. 
I can't go 'home' now because I get panic attacks just thinking about it. 
The knives are out at the solicitors, with her inventing things I've never done and exaggerating other stuff she knew wasn't intentional to justify herself (see post history for info)

.... There's still no excuse to be hit, spat at, clawed or kicked. 
If you're a guy who's never hit back or threatened her, she knows she'll have this power over you - because of the way the world sides when any of this shit comes to light. If you do hit her back, ever, you should leave for both your sakes. 

The first step is to ask to be treated differently, on a day when there's love between you... and be prepared to insist that being treated any other way is a dealbreaker. Make yourself clear. 

If they refuse, saying 'well, if you didn't do X then I wouldn't get like that', leave...
If they say 'but you... ' it doesn't matter what, leave...
If they promise never again, but you still fear it's just around the corner and you're on eggshells, leave. 
If, once you've said it's a dealbreaker and they do it again - then you can state clearly that you'd said this would happen, and be sure you follow through - or you'll never be free. 

Good luck.

I need help,2,"On May 30th I had my fiancé arrested for Domestic Violence.

A little background info: We live in Pennsylvania, we have been together for 3 years, I am 3 months pregnant with my first child (planned), and in the 3 years that we have been together he never put his hands on me.

On May 30th I woke up with a sense of dread, he had been up drinking for at least 24 hours so I knew it was going to be a horrible day.

I would have done my usual; just ignore him and wait for him to sober up. But that couldn't happen because he had his other 2 children here with us for the weekend. 

After an argument filled morning he got in my face. At this point we were in the bedroom and the kids were in the front room. 

He is in my face yelling ""You're going to make me put my hands on you."" Now I am a cop’s daughter and by no means going to sit back and allow someone to threaten me. 
So I told him if he puts his hands on me we are going to have a problem. He then bangs my head against the wall and starts choking me.

At first I fought back and when I got him down I had a moment of clarity and remembered that I was carrying a precious gift inside me and I stopped fighting. 

I told him to get out of the room and he did. Then he came back and threw me on the bed and chocked me again and I am kicking and screaming then he hits me (open palm) in the face and I think time stopped for a second.

I screamed so loud and told him to leave my room. I knew I had to get out; so I got dressed in walked in the front room.

I saw his 2 kids sitting on the couch crying and my heart broke for them, but I announced that I was going to the store.

I really just needed to get out so I could get help. He jumped off the couch and grabbed my neck and he choked me until I saw stars then he took me over to the banister and leaned me backwards over it while choking me. 

His 8 year old son jumped up and yelled “dad let her go,” and he did. I ran to my room and locked the door praying that he didn't know the master key to all the doors are located on the top of all the doors.

I called the cops, and explained what was happening. By this time he is outside the bedroom door loading his gun saying ""I don't care who you call I'm going to kill you and them."" The dispatcher hears this and tells me not to reply, the cops get here but I cannot open the door for them because he is in the front room with a gun ready to kill me. I hear him say ""Somebody's at the door for you, why don't you come let them in.""

At this point I am so scared and then it hits me. I tell the dispatcher to tell the cops to come to the side of the building and I can throw my keys out the window. I do so and I tell them that there are two young kids in the house so please be careful. 

They get in they take him and I take the kids. They searched for his gun and when they found it they found one bullet in it and we all know that it was meant for me.

I learned that my apartment complex also called the cops because they my neighbors called them to tell them what they heard happening.

So after everything died down a little I went to the office for the apartment complex and explained the situation. They sympathized with me, and then said I would have to pay $3000 and have the abuser sign a paper removing him from the lease in order to leave. 

How can they do that, isn't there some sort of laws in place for domestic violence victims? So now I am stuck in an apartment that I cannot afford alone on my salary, trying to prepare for a baby that I will have to raise alone. 

And they are saying there is nothing they can do. I have talked to the domestic violence victim advocates in my county and I know they can pay for relocating but the apartment complex won't budge on the lease requirements. 

My abuser is in prison and has been since they arrested him, and there is a no contact order, so there is no way I can get this paper signed by him. So my question is can they legally keep me here based on the circumstances?

I guess I'd just like a little insight... It's long but please help me?,5,"I've lurked here for a bit because I've had some doubts about my situation.  I'm posting here now to ask for advice, I guess.  

I met this girl about a year ago.  We got along great, fell in love, and about 3 weeks ago moved in together.  About a week before we moved in, she got really strange.  It was my birthday but she wouldn't see me and said she felt obligated and refused to be chained in by obligations.

We were about to move into a shared two-bedroom; one bedroom, one office.  About 7 days before move-in she told me she wanted separate bedrooms.  I said ok, because I thought it would work, right?  We've lived together for about 2-3 weeks now.   

Throughout our relationship she's disregarded my feelings.  Every time I tell her that something she says bothers me, she either tells me that that's a ridiculous way to feel, or she explains to me how what she feels is more important.  

On Saturday I decided to end it.  I explained to her that my feelings aren't being honored, that I don't feel safe telling her my feelings or opinions, and so I can't be in this relationship anymore.  We still live together, but I was prepared to wait out this 6 month lease with an uncomfortable roommate.  That night she said she was going to move out and pay rent on two apartments if she has to, just to be away from me.  I'm OK with that.  I'll now have a two-bedroom to myself for half the price.

Tuesday night I knocked on her door to ask when she thought she would be moving out.  I'm trying to make some plans that would depend on that.  She really flipped out.  She brought up every past fight we'd ever had and yelled at me why I was wrong all those times. She hit my ear.  It was ringing for a while.  I don't remember all of the events.  She choked me to the ground and hit my head on the floor.  She scratched my forearm and drew blood.  She bit my arm and left tooth marks and a bruise.  She hit my hand into a door frame so it's all bruised.  She slapped me about 10 times in a row.  This is the first instance of this kind of behavior.

She broke a plate in the kitchen and picked up a shard and tried to cut herself (she has no history of cutting).  I thought I had finally calmed her down.  I put her to bed, pulled up the covers, shut the door, and went to bed myself.  5 minutes later I heard her in the kitchen.  By the time I got down there she had cut her wrist lightly with a piece of plate.  I grabbed her wrist and got the shard out of her hand.  She continued to attempt to get it, to cut herself, etc.  I ended up holding her from behind with both hands on both of her wrists.  Finally she calmed down and I was able to clean her cuts and bandage them and get her to go to bed.  Was handling her like that wrong?

I wouldn't leave her.  Maybe that was too intrusive?  I didn't feel I could leave someone who'd just hurt themselves.  I stayed in her room, but at a distance, and tried to sleep.  She continued to verbally attack me until about 9am.  

Now she's telling me if I call the cops then she'll tell them I was trying to rape her and her attack was in self defense.  I tried to kiss her once, but she rejected it and I didn't pursue it.  I'm scared of her and I'm scared of getting help.  I think I just want a second (third, fourth) opinion.  I don't know who to call or where to get help.  It's hard to talk on the phone with her here, and I'm having trouble finding help chats.  ",Preparing To Leave
How Can I Help a Friend When I Live Hours Away?,3,"My sister's close friend since childhood is being abused. She called and told my sister that her husband had been hitting her. I am heartbroken but not exactly surprised - he has been grooming her for this for YEARS and I saw it coming well before they were married. Prior to meeting him, she had been in an abusive relationship w/ her son's father. Her self-confidence (which was always shaky) was destroyed. She worked very hard and was able to buy a home for her and her son, even though she didn't make great money and got no financial support for their son from her ex. Then she met this asshole.

He (""husband"") is either a preacher of some sort or evangelical. As his main job, he is a parole officer. Our friend's father committed suicide years ago, and husband was terrible. Our friend is Catholic, and he was putting her down and her family down in this difficult time for saying the rosary, going to mass, etc. At this point, they weren't married and she still had her own home. They broke up.

Somehow they got back together, got married, and she got pregnant almost immediately. Of course she left her home she'd work so hard for to move with him one county over. She quit her job to take care of the kids and is now going to school herself. Husband has escalated years of emotional abuse to physical. He tells her that if she leaves, she will never get custody because he knows so many judges and lawyers, plus she doesn't have a job.

That's where things are right now. I don't think her family has been the greatest at supporting her - it is a large family though and she is closer w/ some siblings than others. My sister lives in our hometown, one county over from our friend. I am about two hours away.

My sister and I are hot-tempered but we know better than to go running off at the mouth at him and putting our friend and her kids in danger. My sister's husband is a police officer, not that it matters here, other than having rank over a parole officer.

What can we do? Are there actual steps we can take in preparation to help her leave (without forcing it on her) or do we just have to wait to see where the chips fall? I know she has a sibling where I live, and I am willing to all I can to help her get in school here and find child care and housing. Supposedly she is working with the abuse shelter in her area.

Any advice would really be appreciated. I worry so much that if this goes on and escalates as it has, that he may kill her and their kids.",Preparing To Leave
My story of domestic abuse,1,"I just wanted to share with you my story of abuse and help any women I can. 


It started off as a whirlwind romance. We met, we fell head over heels and there's when the cracks started to show. He was from South Africa and had to move back as his visa was expiring. Even though we had only been together for 4 months, I already agreed to move there and marry him. 
I noticed his drastic personality shift every time he drank. Although he was never physically aggressive towards me, he would throw huge strops, smash things or go and cry if I didn't pay him attention for a few minutes. Although I was a bit wary of it, it never gave me any cause for concern. 
A couple of weeks before he was due to move back, I found out I was 12 weeks pregnant. I was only 19 at the time and the likelihood of him being able to get a visa to stay if I kept it was slim to none. I also found out during this time while I was suffering with severe morning sickness that he was using dating websites while I was sleeping next to him, sending explicit emails to other women requesting to meet up for sex. A few days after the termination he left to go back home and I was left alone to deal with the total empty feelings of having my baby ripped away from me and his betrayal.
I forgave him and decided to move out there to be with him 6 weeks later.
We got married on Fireworks night and in his usual top form, he got too drunk and passed out before 7pm. 
4 days later I got a call that no child ever wants to hear. My beloved dad had suffered a stroke, and was in ICU. They weren't sure if he would pull through or not. I immediately went in to turmoil and could not focus on anything besides the fact I was 5000 miles away with no way to return. Suddenly the post trauma and guilt of my termination, mixed in with the utter panic of the thought of never seeing my dad again, pushed me in to deep depression. My husband was unsupportive and argumentative. We had just moved in to our new home together and I spent every day inside our room sobbing, I couldn't face nor did I have the mental capacity to socialise with all these people in our flat in this foreign city. I couldn't even pretend to care at the time. My husband would come in to our room drunk, I would ask him to lay with me and he would start screaming at me, 'why would I do that, I'm trying to have fun' or 'are you still fucking crying?!' He never shared his feelings with me over the termination, and didn't even attempt to comfort me and understand I was having an extremely difficult time. 
My mother managed to raise the funds for me to return home over Christmas for 3 weeks and I couldn't wait to get back. I was still having major trust issues over the things he had done behind my back, and his lack of support during one of the most difficult moments of my life only deepened my mistrust in him. While I was home, he wouldn't answer his phone for days at a time, made up stupid excuses like no shop in the entire city had topping up credit, blatantly lied to me when I heard women in the background when we spoke and accused me of being psychotic. He even called me selfish for giving him a hard time as he'd spent 2 days building furniture and hanging mirrors in our bedroom. When I returned to SA, he had done absolutely nothing and blamed lying on me, how I drove him to it because he was sick of me being miserable. I couldn't believe, as my husband, he couldn't support me through all this trauma and instead belittled me for it, and I began to resent him deep down.
Fast forward to my 20th birthday in February, the day he ruined our relationship forever. 
We were at a bar with his friends and his brother. He told me he was going to buy me a drink and headed inside. It had been about 40 minutes and he hadn't come back, so I went out the front to find him sitting alone at a table. I said to him 'thanks for the drink babe' as a joke and he absolutely flipped out and stormed home. I was used to this so I thought nothing of it and didn't attempt to follow him as I wasn't in the mood to have a domestic on the street. We all stayed out for a little longer then returned back to our flat. I found my husband lying with his jeans down in our bathroom, absolutely drunk. I crouched down and gave him a kiss to wake him, and asked him to let me help him up so I could put him in to bed. He completely flipped out and started screaming at me about how he'd spent £100 on my birthday and how horrible I was, even though we'd had a good night and I didn't really understand what his angry gibberish was about. We began to fight and it just got worse and worse. We were walking in and out of different rooms. In our bedroom, he grabbed me and slammed my head in to the wall repeatedly, pushing me and grabbing my arms so hard and squeezing them. After that, he tried to leave through the front door. I stood in front to block his way, asking him to calm down and come to bed. He put his hands around my neck and started to strangle me, and smashing my head in to the pointy bit of the keyhole in the door. He grabbed my by the arms and pulled me in to the kitchen, shaking me violently and pushing me in to the dishwasher. He ran out the front door and I got myself up and followed him down to the gated grounds around our flat, and found him sitting at a lunch bench. He grabbed me again and hit my head in to the table, causing me to bite down on my tongue and draw blood. I hit him around the face in self defence and ran back inside. He followed and the rest is a blur - he must have continued to strangle me and smash my head as I eventually passed out on the floor with a concussion. I woke up in the morning and threw up from the amount of pain I had in my head, and confused as I temporarily forgot what had happened until I saw myself in the mirror horrified by my appearance. I was covered all over in bruises, scratches and finger marks, dried blood around my mouth and the pain from the head wounds was excruciating, even a migraine couldn't compare to it. He woke up as I came in to our room and began to sob uncontrollably, trying to hug me. I can't say I've ever been so disgusted by another person in my life. 
I got out of there and went in to work. My owner told the manager to send me to get a long sleeved top to wear under my uniform after an hour, as I looked like 'trailer trash.' He asked me what happened and I crumbled. My colleagues were horrified, and kindly offered me all their places to stay at despite only have worked there for 2 weeks. I refused as I didn't want to impose at the time and I couldn't even think about what I should do. My dad had just got out of hospital and my mum was readjusting to the new him, his brain crippled by his stroke. After suffering domestic abuse herself in her previous marriage, how could I call her and burden her with this? How could I call my friends and told them they were all right, that I made a huge mistake? The humiliation and shame of my failure was too much. I didn't even know if I should just stay with him and forgive him. I told him he needed to stop drinking and seek help, or I would be gone. He came home drunk from work again and started screaming at me that I was having an affair with a black guy. Luckily our flatmate grabbed him and pushed him back in our room and told him to stay the hell away from me. I began to go to the 24 hour casino after work, and taking up to 2 grams of cocaine every day to keep my going and keep me from giving in and going home to sleep. I came home from work one night jacked up after being on a binge for 3 days with no sleep, and we had sex. I've never felt so ashamed and weak, and burst in to tears. I would go back to shower and run back to work again, and volunteered to work every single day that I could. I was running on autopilot and slowly self destructing, and there was nothing I could do. I couldn't run to my mum, or my best friend. I didn't even know the city or anyone in it. A girl I worked with said her boyfriend hit her but she deserves it every time, as she provokes him. I was horrified listening to her praising this psycho and decided I couldn't allow myself to end up like her, justifying a man harming you and telling yourself it was your fault. 
He called me on Saint Patricks day as he'd seen me out with a colleague, I decided to skip work and go on a bender. He started screaming at me to leave and never come back - the usual phone call, followed by 'please don't go.' I called my flatmates best friend and asked him to let me know when everyone had left for work, so I could pack up my stuff. I left him a note on our bed and erased any sign I was ever there. I was frightened, 5000 miles away from home with next to no money or internet. But whatever happened, nothing could be worse than allowing this emotionally and physically abusive person to do this to me again. 
I went to work and took up my manager on his offer to move in with him, and made the dreaded phone call home. 
I actually decided to stay there for a further 5 months. I wasn't going to run to the comfort of home and beat myself up for wasting my time. I was going to prove to him he couldn't get the best of me, and I could establish my own life there without him. I would do it all again just for those 5 amazing months I spent there, meeting some of the greatest, supportive and kind people the world has to offer.
I suffered on and off with depression for 2 years after this, and sometimes I feel myself sinking in to it again. There's nothing more terrifying and heartbreaking than moving to an unknown country, leaving everything behind to put your trust in to someone to look after you and care for you, but ultimately they are the one person who betrays you. 

I know my story is not as horrific or as complicated as some women have to suffer, but just remember this one thing - someone who is prepared to do this to you does not love you, and nor do they control you. Just because they might pay for rent, or to help you bring up your child, or whatever it is this does NOT mean they own your soul and have the right to harm you. Don't even think of what you'll do next, take your things and walk away and figure out the rest after - go to a shelter or refuge, and realise that for every terrible person in this world there's 10 more who will restore your faith in humanity and treat you with the respect and kindness you deserve. Some of the most supportive people of my situation were complete strangers to me, and they gave me the strength to carry on. Walking away from this misery and cutting off their control over you is the most empowering thing you could do for yourself. You are strong, you are beautiful and you deserve more. I am no longer angry anymore and nor do I blame myself - I don't even care anymore than he told everyone I was having an affair and denied ever laying a finger on me. He sent me a message recently regarding our divorce after 4 years and I'm so indifferent of the situation now I can be the bigger person and talk to him with respect. It's been a long journey and all the wounds have not healed yet, but remember there is hope, life and love for all of you. ",Preparing To Leave
Protect Yourself: A Domestic Violence Safety Plan,0,"""There Is No Greater Threat To Women Than Men""

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDh4qk1Tl8k?wmode=transparent]

We may laugh at the jokes, but the truth is far from funny...

Domestic Violence is an epidemic. Nearly twice as many women were killed in the United States by their male parters than soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. Between 2001 and 2012 6,488 soldiers were killed. The number of American Women murdered by their male partners during that same timeframe was11,766.

For those living with violence, not leaving an abusive relationship does not mean that the situation is okay or that the victim wants to be abused. According to the Department of Justice, the most dangerous time for a woman who is being abused is when she tries to leave, as this is when the abuser realizes they are losing control and will in all likelihood ""do anything"" to get it back. (United States Department of Justice, National Crime Victim Survey, 1995)

If you need help, or even if you just want to get involved, there are social programs and private non-profit organizations like Becky’s Fund which strives to address domestic violence in all sectors of our community, establish prevention-based educational programs to counter domestic violence, and collaborate with others in the community to find ways to change the behavior and thinking behind issues that cause and perpetuate domestic violence.

Your Safety Plan

A Safety Plan is nothing more than a written record of the steps you can take to enhance your personal safety as you prepare in advance for the possibility of future violence. Many templates like this one, are available for free online. These plans help to bring into focus all of the relevant concerns which may exist, allowing you to focus on those areas of greatest importance.

The following are a few of the protective measures to consider:

AWARENESS + PREPARATION = SAFETY

Effective self-defense begins long before a physical altercation. Awareness of your surroundings, awareness of your environment, and awareness of what looks out of place, prepares you physically and mentally for what may come next.

Being aware of the warning signs of danger is a key component of safety. Some of the warning signs of an abusive personality include:

A ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" personality. Acting one way in front of others and another way when alone with you
Invasions of privacy. Reading your e/mail, checking your computer history, or going through your phone.
Following you or sending someone just to ""keep an eye on you""
Accusing you of cheating
Blaming you for their problems or their bad mood
TRUST YOUR GUT

Within each of us is an internal warning system that is perfectly in tune with our subconscious awareness of danger. Unfortunately, we all sometimes negate this early warning with a “Don’t be Mean” rationale.

Your unwillingness to hurt another’s feelings should never be greater than your willingness to protect yourself from harm. If it feels “bad,” that’s your subconcious trying to protect you. Women are naturally more in tune to this gift. Learn to trust this power and use it to your full advantage.

KEEP A JOURNAL

Keep a written record of everything leading up to and during each instance of abuse. Write down with as much detail the date, time, descriptions, thoughts, feelings and fears you experienced in that moment. Try to write while things are still fresh in your mind. Be sure to keep whatever you write someplace safe and secure. Include photos of injuries whenever possible.

HOME ZONES OF SAFETY

If you feel abuse is going to happen, try to move to an area that offers you the best chance to get away. Identify those safe places in your home where you can easily escape and where there are no nearby weapons (kitchen = knives) Areas near the front door are best as they most often lead to the street and front yards in view of neighbors. Back and side doors commonly lead to additional enclosures like fences with obstructing views. When in doubt, go down and out.

SAFE HAVENS

Know your safe havens. Even if you have no immediate plan to leave, identifying safe haven’s is an excellent everyday safety precaution for those times you may find yourself away from home and in potential harm. When in doubt: “Run to a Restaurant.” Restaurant’s are easy to find, easy to access and are full of people who can help. They will also have food, water, first aid, and phones so can contact your support team. Have a plan. Know where to go. Know how to get there.

PACK AND PLAN AHEAD

Pack and hide a “Go-Bag.” A go-bag is a pre-packed bag you have ready to “go” at a moment’s notice. Pack this with the important things you use everyday. Include some non-perishable eatables like gum, trail mix, and a large bottle of water. In addition to necessities like clothes and personal items, try to include cash, pre-paid gift /credit cards, and a pre-paid “burner” phone which will help you successfully get away without being easily tracked and monitored.

USE DRAFT EMAIL

Create a free email account and save important information in an unsent draft email.This will allow you to access the information from anywhere with an internet connection. Draft emails, in an account known only to you, are a great place for you to securely upload digital images of important documents and files. If you have to leave in a hurry, it helps to know you will still have access to this information everywhere regardless of your location.

CHILD SAFETY

It is very important for children to understand that the best way to protect you is to get to a safe place and call for help. Practice calling 911 with your children on both your home and mobile phone. It’s also good a good idea for them to rehearse what they will say. This simple phrase is all a dispatcher needs to hear to send help to your location. Remember to teach them to NOT hang up.

“My Mommy needs help. Please send police and ambulance.”

TRY FOR CHANGE

Whenever possible, try to change your daily routine. Even subtle changes like the route you to take to school and work, or the grocery store where you shop may provide enough freedom in your schedule to plan an escape.

CODE WORDS

Have a ‘Safe’ word/phrase. When moments matter you may not be able to text or say much. Have an agreed ‘safe’ word or phrase with trusted friends and family who are familiar with your situation and who are able to respond if they receive any emergency calls/texts. Keep it short and simple, but easy enough to phrase into a sentence without drawing unwanted attention. This example was particularly clever.

DON’T “CHECK-IN”

Turn off your geo-location function. Sharing your location on FourSquare, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is great for letting your friends know what you are doing, but it also makes it easier to track the trends of your daily routine and even find you at a specific location. If you're ""checking in"" at the local cinema, It tells anyone who may be trying to find you where you will be for the next two hours.

STAY SAFETY FIT

When it comes to staying safe, your ability to push, jump, and run may make all the difference. Are you safety fit?https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140902150126-11537006-are-you-safety-fit?trk=mp-reader-card

STAY SOCIAL MEDIA SAFE

Make sure you have all of your privacy settings turned on and be mindful of how much personal information you share online. Spend 15 minutes trying to find out as much about yourself as you can. (Yes, Google yourself.) Make sure you personally know everyone you are connected to on social media and ignore random requests from strangers you don’t know.

Growing up with domestic violence,0,"My past:
I'm an only child who grew up with an alcoholic father who physically abused my mother for twenty years. I was always acting as a shield of protection, because he wouldn't hit me, only broke my things. That's the tip of the iceberg. I remember spending one Christmas on the streets with my mother, walking around the block all night to keep from the cold, trying to get into the flat every few hours. He was drunk and wouldn't let us in. I developed some amazing skills, like being able to tell exactly how drunk someone is. Hearing the sound of a locked door being opened from the outside freaks me out still - when he came home after a night of drinking, that sound told me how drunk he is and what to expect. The kitchen knives were hidden in my cupboard, because we were scared that he will kill my mum. I slept in my clothes many times, so we could run if we had to. I went to neighbors, begging for help. One of them was a police officer. He refused to get involved. I was twelve that time. My mother stayed with him for twenty years. She says that the first time he beat her was when she was 6 months pregnant with me. I left when I was 18. I have no positive memories about my father. Not one. 
My present:
I am 32 two years old (F) and never had a successful relationship. I fall in love with guys fast and hard, but they never reciprocate my feelings. When my heart gets broken, I'm completely devastated, depressed and obsessive. For years. One heartbreak lasts approximately three years to recover from. I've been in therapy for years and I know that my childhood is the cause of my relationship problems, which stem mainly from a very low self-esteem and inconsistent identity. But knowing this didn't change anything.
My future: 
I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm prepared to try anything, even thought of going for an LSD therapy to try to gain a new perspective on things. Confronting my father or trying to talk to him is impossible. He is currently suing me for money and is too far gone. No self awareness whatsoever, me and my mother are evil for leaving him. Last time I tried having a conversation with him, he told me, that I was a slut just like my mother. So no, talking things over is not an option. 

My hopes:
By sharing our experiences and stories with each other, maybe we could understand ourselves more and find ways to heal. I'm kind of desperate here and I would love to hear stories from adult children who grew up under similar circumstances. How did you cope? How does it affect your life and your relationships? Do you have any advice?

I met Teresa Wilson the day her daughter Laura was murdered....,1,"LAURA

At one time in my life the term “Domestic Violence” used to be just words I used. 

It was the type of call I went on.  How I characterized the assault I had investigated.   It was how I knew which bail hearing form to fill out.

But I did not understand it.  Not really. 

I recall at one point in my career the term “domestic” became synonymous with “frustration”.   Frustration that the victim wouldn’t leave.   Frustration that they would leave, only to return.  Frustration that the case I had worked so hard on had been dropped because the victim said they lied - when I knew they hadn’t.

And while I believe I never ran out of compassion or empathy, and always tried hard to do a good job, I never really understood.

Laura Wilson and her mother Teresa changed that for me.

********

I met Teresa Wilson the day Laura was murdered.  

As we stood in their beautiful home, surrounded by family photos, I felt very much the intruder, invading a grieving family’s most private moments.   Teresa, her oldest son Paul and her youngest daughter Sue sat with us as we explained what we knew and the charges we had laid.  Between breathless sobs and flowing tears Teresa asked intelligent and insightful questions.  She told us about Laura, a beautiful and outgoing young woman.  Vivacious, with many friends, 23 year old Laura had been raised in a loving, stable home.  Teresa spoke of Laura’s life-long love of hockey and how when she could not find a team to play on she started and managed her own women’s team.
We learned that only 10 months earlier Laura had been the one to discover the body of her father, Tony, after an apparent heart attack.  

*******

Laura met the man who would ultimately take her life in high school.  They had become friends and had dated for a brief time.  In 2002, he contacted Laura out of the blue and they rekindled their relationship and eventually moved in together.

Jealousy and possessiveness can sometimes be misconstrued as signs of love.  But it was clear that Laura saw something in this man that her family did not.  She fell deeply in love and when Teresa raised concerns Laura staunchly defended him. 

Teresa said that Laura always saw the best in others.

For two years Laura became increasingly exposed to controlling and coercive behavior, isolation from her close friends, threats and intimidation, and ultimately violence.  Laura ended the relationship in November of 2004 and moved into her mother's condominium.

Unable to accept that the relationship was over, he made numerous calls to her home, work and cell phone. At first, he tried to work things out but when it became clear that Laura had decided to move on the comments became abusive and demeaning.  He would show up at various bars and restaurants where she would be with friends and where scenes were caused.  He once came to her home in the middle of the night.

Through some of these very public and embarrassing incidents, Laura steadfastly refused to acknowledge the concerns about this bizarre behavior.  An extremely proud person, Laura refused to admit that she was ever afraid of the man she once loved or that she needed help. 
  
On January 9th, 2005, after a night out with friends, Laura and her close friend Kim Fleet were at Laura's home.  At about 4:00am, the man who once loved Laura dressed himself in black, drove to her home, smashed in a front bedroom window and entered the home.  He brought with him a knife which he used to stab Laura multiple times.  Kim was also stabbed while trying to protect Laura.  She is only alive today by her split second decision to run for help. 

*********

On the day of Laura’s murder, I interviewed her killer.  He, who once made Laura smile, was full of hate.   For all of his bravado, it was his inability to handle rejection that was my only lasting impression.  

*********

After we were finished providing the information we knew, Teresa told us that she would like to see Laura.  We were aware of the brutality of the attack, the nature of Laura’s facial injuries, and we said that we didn’t think that it was a good idea - that she should not see her daughter that way. Teresa insisted.

The next morning, standing in the morgue, I watched as the attendant drew back the sheet and watched as Teresa melted into herself, crying and whispering “My baby…, my baby…”   Tears filled my eyes and I struggled to remain composed.  
I could not speak... 
I could not think… 
I was not a police officer in that moment.  I was a human being overwhelmed by an act that had caused indescribable suffering and incredible loss.      

Over the next two years I came to know Teresa, Paul, his fiancée Cari, Sue and their extended family.  In the face of unknowable sorrow, they remained valiant in their attempts to be strong and carry on.        

I also came to know Kim Fleet, a gifted NCAA women’s hockey player, who transformed by grief and sadness, became a former shell of herself.  Shouldered by her loving parents, her brother and sister, and buoyed by her close-knit network of friends, Kim slowly grew stronger.

Sadness, the true debilitating kind, has been mostly a stranger to me.  The death of my mother when I was in my early 20’s was difficult but years of illness, I think, had prepared me to be resilient.  When I met with Teresa over the next few years, I came to understand what true sadness is.  A woman with incredible faith in God, Teresa always greeted me with a smile and a hug.  I came to admire her intelligence, her strong convictions, her fairness and understanding of others and how they were dealing with their grief, her positivity, and the absolute unabashed love of her entire family.  

But while Teresa tried to put up a strong front, our visits would always end in tears.  Her grief and despondence so overwhelming, she once slumped to her knees in distraught. 

******

On February 8, 2006, the court accepted a guilty plea to Second Degree Murder.  The man who had once loved Laura was sentenced to life in prison without parole eligibility for 17 years.

On the day of his sentencing, one of the most selfless acts of humanity I have ever witnessed occurred.  Teresa asked to speak to her daughter’s killer.  She met with him in private and told him that based on her beliefs and her faith in God, she had forgiven him.  She asked that he not waste what remained of his life and try again to become the man that Laura had fallen in love with.  

And while she had forgiven, it was clear to all of those around her that Teresa never stopped grieving the loss of her beautiful daughter and the life that she and her family could never have.

****** 

On Mar 11, 2007 Teresa Wilson died.  

There was no anatomical cause of death.  

“Died of a broken heart”, I believe, is no longer a cliché.

*******

The tsunami of emotion and devastation created on that January day has now slowed to a quiet, calm ripple that will never stop.  

And while I do not always get it right (rarely is there an ability to unveil fully what goes on behind closed doors), I think I now come from a greater sense of understanding and, most certainly, patience.  

Frustration is now reserved for those who have the capacity to change their destructive behavior but don’t. 

It is the hope of Laura’s family that by sharing their story that all of the “Laura’s” of the world and all those who think they have a “Laura” in their life, will seek support.   Perhaps it will be in the form of a phone call to your local abuse centre or hotline, to a women’s shelter, to the Children’s Aid Society when young ones are in the home, to a knowledgeable friend or family member, or to the police.   

Perhaps this never-ending, but calm wave, will ebb to your shore and change your life and perspective as it has mine.

",Preparing To Leave
Were my parents being abusive toward each other? (TW: Probably Violence?),3,"TW: Physical and Emotional Violence? (Unsure if it counts, but just in case)

First of all, I wanted to make clear that English is not my first language, so sorry if there's any grammar mistake.

Now, some information: I'm 17 y/o and my parents are already divorced years from now (Not legally because other issues, but they're no longer in a relationship) and since a couple of days I've been questioning my self if their relationship was abusive. My memories are kinda blurry but after years from the events something doesn't feel right.

My parents were the type that fights a lot. My memories are plagged with their discussions and for me was (and still is) the principal characteristic of their relationship. At the beginning I thought it was normal, like ""every couple fights"" but now I think there were things that can be considered abuse:

1.- My dad blamed everything on my mom. All his failures, his reactions, his behavior, everything was my mom's fault. Never took responsibility of his actions.

If he was like he was it was because some mistake my mom did (E: He blamed on her that he had to work long hours because she didn't had a job and was a housewife, we'll get into that later)


2.- He called her names. In almost every fight I remember him calling my mom ""a little sick"", crazy, and basically downplaying her with that.


3.- They hurted each other physically a couple of times. My mom kicked my dad once, and he grabbed her by the arm to the point of leaving bruises like twice (That I know)


4.- My dad threatened to call the police. My dad, after the kick, called the police (as he warned a couple of times) and we were all night at police station. For some reason finally nothing happened and we went back home. 

After that, my dad used that threat and that it wouldn't be ""that easy next time"" with the police in arguments. 


5.- He always minimized her bc she didn't finish her career. I was born in their university years, and even though my mom made it until her last year, she didn't finish. My dad almost every fight remind her that, used the ""I'm the breadwinner"" card just because she didn't had a job, and basically said that was the cause of all their problems.

My mom after some years wanted to retake her career or find a job, but my dad wasn't very helpful and didn't really supported her, so she ended up confined to the housework and childcare.

Even if that wasn't his intention, that affected my mom social life and she didn't really have many friends (plus, we were living in a city almost 3 hours away of their hometown, so no direct family/best friends for her).


6.- My mom also insulted him, but I don't remember any particular insult o name that was repetitive more than he wasn't really collaborative or he was selfish.

Finally, some facts that may be useful 

-When my mom fist told my dad he was pregnant he accused her of cheating and even called her a slut (But she justified him with ""He was young and scared)

-My dad's childhood was kinda messy (Parents also divorced)

-My dad prioritized his job and kinda himself over us. When I was little broke a lot of promises of visiting me (we didn't live together) and even under the same roof ignored us/left us aside bc he was focusing in his thesis and other projects.

-He left my mom on the middle of her retaking university (And little later he had already a new partner)


And I guess that is, or at least what I remember. Sorry if it's too long but I wanted to make things clear and I really need to know the real weight of the situation for my and my mom's inner peace (Also, I think she isn't really over it and I need more basis to her going back to therapy).
